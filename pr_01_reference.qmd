# Reference data

## Naming/numbering sites and site collections

- tips for robust systems for projects of varying scale
- tips for working across multiple teams
- distinguishing site IDs from database IDs (e.g. you might want a UUID but you don't want to be writing one out by hand)
- tagging by eg. transect membership

## Date/Time

- YYYY-MM-DD
- time optional but can be useful for connecting site data to photos etc

## Authors

- pick one responsible officer for the description, note the others
- note: privacy law - don't put this data in public-facing downloads without anonymising
