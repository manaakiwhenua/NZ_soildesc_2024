# Horizon colour

## Matrix colour

-   define the concept first - dominant by area, or by process?

### Colour coding

-   munsell and short code options
-   how to record accurately (good light, sunnies off)
-   note: obtaining colour data from photos (infobox)

## Colour patterns

### Pattern type

-   redox, mixing, weathering

### Pattern size

-   overall - 'fabric' - fine/medium/coarse, nest in overall size classes

### Pattern shape

-   blotches, stripes

### Pattern distinctness

-   faint distinct prominent

-   note: can automate this in DB if all colours are Munsell

note: other manuals often effectively 'double up' colour patterns with e.g. segregations, trying to avoid this and cut redundancy
