# Land surface

-   scale is landform - immediate surrounds

## Surface cover

-   record components as percent composition:

-   bare ground (sediment or soil, \<2mm)

-   bare gravels (includes shells, bones etc)

-   bare outcrop

-   open water/ice/snow

-   peat

-   dry leaf litter (includes seed pods)

-   grass/moss/herbs

-   stems/trunks/roots

-   record only to nearest 5-10%, no need to get carried away

-   this should be able to be connected back to landform characteristics - don't repeat yourself here by e.g. recording gravel lithology again

## Surface condition

-   aus list should be ok - but that requires dry conditions, something of an issue in NZ
-   include crusts here

## Surface cracking

-   modal width
-   modal distance
-   spatial arrangement (note connection to freeze-thaw, slip)
-   note: WRB includes crack persistence but this might be a problem - speculative
-   note: requires season and recent weather data for context

## Surface water

-   (where known)
-   flood frequency basically (use wrb list)

## Microrelief

-   get something a bit simpler out of the aus and wrb systems
-   nz - creep and slump features, terracettes, etc

## Anthropogenic alterations

-   start with WRB list but needs some development/local tuning
