# Secondary features {#sec-secondary}

Secondary soil features are bodies formed within the soil through pedogenic (natural soil-forming) processes. They contain a higher amount of a particular substance (or association of substances) and thus contrast with the surrounding material. Many of these features create barriers to water movement or alter chemistry in a way that affects both soil biota and plant root growth.

## Concentrations {#sec-hr-conc}

Concentrations are secondary features that are not associated with specific surfaces within the soil. Some concentrations contrast sharply with the surrounding material due to differences in colour, hardness, or composition, while others may be more subtle.

For rapid assessment, record concentration form and abundance percentage using @tbl-hr-concform.

For detailed assessment, note form, type, abundance in percentage, and size range in millimetres. Colour is not required as it is usually determined by type and may have already been recorded as a colour pattern (@sec-col-patt). Abundance and size can be classified using @tbl-in-size and @tbl-in-abgen respectively.

Example: [NO F 10% 6-8 mm]{.ceg} for scattered small ironstone nodules.

## Coatings {#sec-hr-coat}

Coatings are layers of material that form on  the surfaces of other soil features, e.g. grains, peds, or the walls of voids. Some coatings are formed by chemical precipitation, similar to concentrations, while others form as a result of selective removal processes, where the material left behind accumulates. Some coatings may be biological in origin (e.g. some ant species line their burrow tunnel walls with fine material).

To record coatings, note their type using the options in @tbl-hr-coattype and their abundance as percentage of soil surfaces covered. For rapid assessment, only record the most abundant or well-developed coating.

e.g. [OG 80%]{.ceg} for well-developed organic coats covering most ped surfaces.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-hr-coattype
#| tbl-cap: "Types of surface coating"

dat_hr_coattype <-
  tribble(~Code, ~Name, ~Description,
          'CC', 'Clay coats', 'Appear to have more clay than the soil matrix. They are often different in colour from the adjacent matrix and are usually recognisable in sandy or loamy soils, but can be difficult to recognise in clayey soils.',

## Pans {#sec-pan}

Pans form when particular chemical compounds precipitate out of the soil solution and cement a layer of mineral particles (perhaps as a further accumulation and joining together of coatings and/or concentrations), or when particular particle size distributions and/or shape range become very tightly packed. Many pans are diagnostic layers in the New Zealand Soil Classification, because they can form a barrier to plant root growth or water movement.

For rapid assessment, only record pans that are strongly developed enough to be classification-relevant. A classification-relevant pan is one that is developed enough to meet all of the relevant diagnostic requirements listed in the New Zealand Soil Classification. Record the pan type using @tbl-hr-pantype.

Many (but not all) pans have dedicated conventional horizon names. The full definitions of those horizons are available in @sec-hzn-conv.

Pans can be described in detail in terms of type, thickness, continuity, structure, strength and cementation. Pans comprise distinct horizons, so their thickness is defined using horizon boundaries. Their strength and cementation are assessed using @tbl-cn-str and @tbl-cn-ind. Codes for type, continuity and structure are given below in @tbl-hr-pantype, @tbl-hr-pancont, and @tbl-hr-panstr. Note that continuity can only be observed in large pits or exposures.

## Stress features {#sec-hr-stress}

Stress features develop along fissures or on ped faces in soils that shrink and swell as water content changes. Stress features are usually shiny but do not differ in colour from the soil matrix. Magnification may be required to observe them clearly. Stress features will not develop in sandy soil textures (see @tbl-hr-earthgrps).

Stress features can be optionally noted during a detailed soil description. Describe type using @tbl-hr-pftype and abundance as integer percentage of ped faces covered.

Example: [SL 30%]{.ceg} in a well-developed Vertic Melanic soil.

## Cryofeatures {#sec-cryof}

Cryoturbation refers to the physical disturbance and mixing of soil caused by repeated freezing and thawing. It commonly occurs in soils exposed to seasonal or historic freeze and thaw cycles. Affected soils may show discontinuous horizon boundaries and physical mixing as a result of intense shrink-swell activity caused by ice formation. Freezing and thawing can also accelerate downslope movement (solifluction), often incorporating angular, poorly sorted rock fragments into the soil. These features can be recognised by examining horizon boundary characteristics (@sec-pr-bdyshp, @sec-pr-bdydist), colour patterns from mixing (@sec-patt-type), and rock fragment characteristics (@sec-rockfrag).
