## Vegetation

Recording vegetation during soil survey can reveal reveal relationships between soil and vegetation communities.

Several options are available in New Zealand for recording vegetation data in a soils context.

-   A detailed assessment of vegetation at a soil site can be made using the RECCE standard [@hurst2022]. This is the method used by the [NZ National Vegetation Survey](https://nvs.landcareresearch.co.nz/), and it allows creation of a complete record of vegetation structure and species assemblage. Some elements of the RECCE standard have been adopted elsewhere in this manual, where relevant to describing the landscape and land surface (@sec-pr-surfcov). Note that considerable botanical experience is needed to apply the full RECCE standard correctly.
-   If the soil description is being completed in the context of an LUC assessment, use the NZLRI Vegetation Descriptions available in Appendix 3 of the LUC Survey Handbook [@lynn2009]. This system describes a set of 49 vegetation communities commonly found in New Zealand, grouped into five broad structural categories (grasses, crops, scrub, forest, and herbaceous). Ability to identify key local species will be required to apply the system correctly.

Simpler systems that attempt to break vegetation communities into key structural classes are available, including the 'Atkinson system' recommended in the previous version of this manual. These are easy to apply but may not adequately discriminate between vegetation communities in a way that is soils-relevant.

## Fauna

### Macrofauna

-   dominant species that significantly and directly affect the soil - diggers, stompers, prolific poopers
-   current vs past (e.g. farm system vs earthworms under former forest cover)
-   scale range elephants to ants
-   not a must have but worth keeping front of mind when classifying/interpreting features

### Microfauna
