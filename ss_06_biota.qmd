# Biota {#sec-biota}

Soil biota both affects and is affected by soil type. For example, Kauri trees create acidic conditions around their root zone, leading to the development of podzolic features.  

## Vegetation {#sec-veg}

Recording vegetation during soil survey can reveal reveal relationships between soil and vegetation community composition and structure.

Several options are available in New Zealand for recording vegetation data in a soils context.

-   A detailed assessment of vegetation at a soil site can be made using the RECCE standard [@hurst2022]. This is the method used by the [NZ National Vegetation Survey](https://nvs.landcareresearch.co.nz/), and it allows creation of a complete record of vegetation structure and species assemblage. Some elements of the RECCE standard have been adopted elsewhere in this manual, where relevant to describing the landscape and land surface (@sec-gmph-other, @sec-pr-surfcov). Note that considerable botanical experience is needed to apply the full RECCE standard correctly.
-   If the soil description is being completed in the context of an LUC assessment, use the NZLRI Vegetation Descriptions available in Appendix 3 of the LUC Survey Handbook [@lynn2009]. This system describes a set of 49 vegetation communities commonly found in New Zealand, grouped into five broad structural categories (grasses, crops, scrub, forest, and herbaceous). Ability to identify key local species will be required to apply the system correctly. The system can also be used for rapid vegetation assessment during other soil mapping activities.

Simpler systems that attempt to break vegetation communities into key structural classes are available, including the 'Atkinson system' recommended in the previous version of this manual. These are easy to apply but may not adequately discriminate between vegetation communities in a way that is soils-relevant.

## Fauna {#sec-fauna}

### Megafauna {#sec-fauna-mega}

Soil megafauna are large species that significantly and directly affect the soil, usually by mechanical disturbance or organic material addition. In New Zealand this role was largely filled by birds and reptiles before the arrival of humans. Since then, the niche has been dominated by domesticated sheep, goats and cows, as well as feral goats, pigs and rabbits. Significant increases in the volume of animal wastes added to many soils have also occurred, most intensely on land converted to pastoral agriculture.

The influence of these animals is generally captured elsewhere in a soil description (e.g. @sec-pr-dist) and so no further recording requirements are defined here.

### Macrofauna

Body width 2-20 mm
e.g. earthworms, ants, termites
'ecosystem engineers'
indirect observations e.g. worm burrows


### Mesofauna

Body width 0.1 - 2.0 mm
lives mostly in air-filled pores
little impact on structure

### Microfauna {#sec-fauna-small}

Body width < 0.1 mm
lives mostly in water-filled pores
little/no impact on structure
