Record sensor type against the schema in Table 3.1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Location data source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nGS\nSingle-band GNSS\nSatellite based location, single band\n\n\nGM\nMulti-band GNSS\nSatellite based location, multiple band\n\n\nGR\nDifferential GNSS\nSatellite based location, on-ground correction\n\n\nLM\nMulti-sensor\nCombined GNSS and other location data e.g. mobile phone towers, wifi routers and nearby devices.\n\n\nNO\nNone\nLocation determined manually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-constellation GNSS is not the same as multi-band GNSS. The former signifies access to multiple location satellite networks operated by various parties, e.g. GPS (USA), Galileo (EU), BeiDou (China). This can improve signal consistency due to having access to more total satellites, but not necessarily overall accuracy.\nMulti-band GNSS involves receiving signals from location satellites on multiple frequency bands. The extra data from each satellite can significantly improve connection reliability and accuracy, particularly when open sky is restricted by rough terrain, dense vegetation or poor weather.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost consumer electronic devices capable of reporting location will be LM type by default, unless using an app that actively forces a GNSS-only connection. At the time of writing, most of these devices can still only report GS quality data with such apps due to hardware limitations. As such, these devices can be extremely accurate in urban areas and much less so elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimating location manually using e.g. topographic maps and orienteering methods remains an option, but should usually be considered a last resort.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Elevation measurement\nParts of New Zealand still lack highly accurate elevation data. Elevation can also change suddenly in response to major tectonic activity. Record the elevation data source used against the schema in Table 3.1, or use one of the additional options in Table 3.2 below.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Elevation data sources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\n\n\n\n\nE\nEstimate\n\n\nA\nMeasured by a calibrated altimeter\n\n\nM\nInterpolated from contour map with interval of ≤ 20 m, or extracted from similar-quality Digital Elevation Model (DEM)\n\n\nD\nExtracted from high-accuracy DEM (Lidar or similar)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe M code should be used for most non-Lidar DEMs, as those available for public use were constructed from interpolated contour data or other methods with comparable vertical accuracy (see Barringer, Pairman, and McNeill 2002; Uuemaa et al. 2020) .\nWhere the A code is used, the time and location of the most recent altimeter calibration should be noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere DEMs are used, they should be as contemporary as possible; New Zealand’s rate of landscape evolution is relatively high and these data sources will become less reliable with age. DEMs more than 20 years old should be accompanied by a vertical error estimate adjusted upwards for age.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Coordinate reference system (CRS)\nRecord X and Y location coordinates using New Zealand Transverse Mercator (EPSG:2193). For Z coordinates (elevation), use the New Zealand Vertical Datum 2016 (EPSG:1169).\nX and Y precision does not need to exceed 1 m for pits, or 0.1 m for cores and auger holes. Z precision will rarely need to exceed 0.1 m.\nExample: 1586090E, 5405722N (462 m)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany location sensors default to the global longitude-latitude based WGS84 datum (EPSG:4326). As a global system, its maximum accuracy is around 3 m, and coordinate accuracy also degrades over time due to continental drift. This is compensated for using a date-based ‘epoch’ adjustment. Because of these limitations, WGS84 should only be used when reconciling data from multiple locations on a global scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternate geocoding systems involving e.g. text-based encoding or nested hashes should be avoided during fieldwork. The systems are often proprietary, sometimes prone to ambiguity or edge-case errors, and at their core often wrap around WGS84 anyway. They may still be useful during data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Expected Error\nExpected horizontal error can be automatically reported by equipment, or estimated. When estimating, record in meters with a maximum precision of 0.01 (1 cm) e.g. ± 5.1 m. Record expected vertical elevation error separately in the same units, as it will differ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite location data quality can often be improved by revising the locations in GIS after fieldwork. Where corrections are made, expected error from the measuring instrument should be overridden with a new manual estimate of expected error.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Temporal\nRecord the date of observation using the ISO 8601 standard, YYYY-MM-DD (International Organization for Standardization 2019). Time is not essential but may be useful for correlating site descriptions with photographs.",

    "text": "3.2 Relative location\nAbsolute locations are enhanced by information about what is nearby. This context is useful for checking that a site’s coordinates are correct and for revisiting a site in future.\n\n3.2.1 Relative elevation\nElevation above the nearest down-slope drainage (open/flowing water, swampy ground, or a closed depression) is useful for landscape interpretations. The data can also be used to group site descriptions, for instance when identifying sets of related terraces along river systems. The drainage feature to record against must be identified by tracing a path down-slope from the observation point, and may be far from the point of observation. As such, it will normally be more efficient to estimate this parameter after fieldwork using elevation and imagery data.\nRecord relative elevation in meters, with a precision of no more than 0.01 (1 cm).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith sufficiently detailed inputs, a Relative Elevation Model (REM) can be constructed to estimate this parameter, but will need to be ground-truthed.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Triangulating off local features\nAbsolute location data can be backed up by measuring to nearby permanent or long-term features. This is particularly useful for relocating long-term monitoring plots. For this to work well, features should be within ~50 m of the target location and sufficiently sturdy to last until at least the next expected visit. Examples include fencelines, buildings, roads, and rock outcrops.\nFor single-point sites, measure distance and direction using a tape and compass. Accuracy is improved by measuring to two or more features. For plot-based sites, one can measure from at least two corners to the target feature. Photographing the point/plot and reference points together is also useful.\nadd a diagram here\n\n\n3.2.3 Long-form descriptions\nFor observation points that will be revisited, record practical information about how to return. This may include landholder contact details and records of previous interactions, notes about track conditions, locked gates, and potential hazards like water crossings. Spatial data recording the track from the nearest public road to the target location is particularly valuable.\n\n\n3.2.4 Administrative location\nTagging sites with their administrative region(s) can help with discoverability (searching and filtering) in databases, and simplify information security and privacy arrangements. This does not need to be done in the field, provided accurate locations are recorded.\nIn New Zealand, relevant boundaries include Regional Council (Stats NZ 2023a) and Territorial Authority (District Council, Stats NZ (2023b)) areas. Note that these boundaries are periodically updated so need to be related to date of observation.\n\n\n3.2.5 Temporal\nRelative temporal data focuses on time since significant soil-influencing events. These can provide context for the parameters recorded, and some are especially useful when interpreting laboratory results.\nOnly include recent events directly affecting the site. ‘Recent’ is a relatively flexible concept which highlights the reasons some parameters observed might be locally unusual. Some of these events recur regularly (e.g. tillage) so only need to be noted if very recent (e.g. previous week).\nIf the time since the event is known with certainty, also record as number of days since the event.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.3: Recent soil-affecting events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\n\n\n\n\nMC\nMechanical disturbance (e.g. tillage, deep ripping)\n\n\nCL\nMechanical vegetation clearance (e.g. clearfelling)\n\n\nSL\nLandslide event - soil lost from site\n\n\nSD\nLandslide event - soil added to site\n\n\nWI\nWind-induced treefall\n\n\nFC\nFire - controlled burn\n\n\nFW\nFire - uncontrolled burn\n\n\nFL\nFlooding - freshwater\n\n\nFS\nFlooding - saline water (e.g. storm surge event)\n\n\nPO\nPollution event (e.g. petrol spill)\n\n\nNO\nNo recent events\n\n\nUK\nUnknown",

Soil data is stored for long periods and is often re-used for multiple projects; specific re-uses may not be appropriate.\nRecord the spatial sampling strategy used using the schema in Table 3.4.

Data-driven sites are nominated using a loose set of rules or principles (e.g. “visit the major landforms on this farm but don’t go too far off the tracks”) and may be subject to minor changes once the worker is on-ground. Model-based site choices formalise this process with reference to specific input datasets, and the worker is committed to sample at the exact point chosen. Model-based methods may include ‘backup points’ for where an intended location cannot be physically accessed, but these are also pre-determined. Importantly, model-based choices can be regenerated from the same inputs.\nArbitrary A points are not pre-determined at all; rather, they are chosen after the worker is on site, in response to direct observation of on-ground conditions. These are often practical and time-efficient but are also likely to over-sample the more easily accessible and/or interesting parts of the landscape, to the detriment of overall representativeness.\nRandom, transect and grid sampling R, T, G effectively ignore environmental parameters. This is useful when the spatial distribution of a parameter of interest is unknown or poorly understood.\nSome of these methods can be combined - for example, data-driven transect choices with randomised locations along each. In such cases, the ‘last choice’ should be recorded - in this case, R. The details of the full sampling strategy should be discussed in project metadata.\n\n\n3.3.2 Site purpose\nThe original task for which a site was observed can affect what data is recorded and is relevant to data re-use decisions.\nRecord the reason for sampling using the schema in Table 3.5.

The soil they describe may be removed or sealed after observation, limiting data re-use potential. M monitoring sites imply repeated, regular re-sampling activity and perhaps an expectation of minimal major disturbance between visits.\nV validation sites may be low-detail, as they are intended to confirm or deny a prediction. T reference sites (T for ‘type’) may be expected to have high morphological detail and a lot of accompanying analytical data, as they represent ‘ideal’ profiles for particular soil classes.\nE mapping exploration sites may have biased, opportunistic sample locations and moderate location precision, while R sites are more likely to have been predetermined by a model and located with high precision.\n\n\n\n\nBarringer, James R.

As described in (Soil and Terrain 2009, 45), relief can be visualised by picturing two surfaces roughly parallel to the land surface - one passing through local crests and one through local depressions.

Slope steepness affects many soil processes, notably water run-off and infiltration behaviour.\nDirect measurements of slope should be taken at the landform scale, over a minimum distance of 20 meters. Stand 10 m up-slope from the soil site and measure downhill. Record in units of degrees, with a maximum precision of 0.1. Precision needs will vary with slope and survey purpose; whole number degrees are fine on any slope over about 5 degrees, but finer gradations can be useful for defining low-relief landforms.\nSlope classes may be applied to the recorded data; some options are presented in Section 25.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtracting slope from DEMs\n\n\n\nSlope data for a site can be extracted from a DEM, provided some conditions are met:\n\nCell size should be less than 10 m; larger cells systematically underestimate local slope\nDEM source should ideally be of type D for acceptable accuracy (see Section 3.1.2)\nExtract the median slope within a 20 m radius, not the single value directly under the recorded point\nReview and, if necessary, adjust slopes extracted from sites described on exposures. These may be overestimates (e.g. where a track cuts into a slope, the values upslope behind the site would better represent the landform). Similarly, sites close to landform or landscape boundaries may also need review.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Aspect\nAspect is the direction a slope faces. Slope aspect helps determine exposure to sun, rain and prevailing winds, and so influences the biome growing in a particular soil. In some environments it also helps determine how much new material is received by deposition.\nAspect should be measured at the same time and over the same transect as slope. Record aspect in whole degrees clockwise from North, using the range [0-359] (360 == 0). Use NA for flat ground. Use NR if unable to record.\nFor rapid assessment, record compass bearing on an 8 or 16 point scale (e.g. NE, SSE).\n\nTODO Note: defining ‘flat’ in soil survey.\nTODO Note: map vs magnetic north, and consequences for field-measured vs DEM-derived aspect measurements\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Landform element morphology\nThe following is adapted from (Soil and Terrain 2009, 19–26).\nLandform elements can be assigned to a morphological type - one of a series of simple shapes - at the scale of observation. These are:\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Landform Element Morphologies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\n\n\n\n\nCR\nCrest\n\n\nRI\nRidge\n\n\nSL\nSlope\n\n\nFL\nFlat\n\n\nDO\nOpen depression\n\n\nDC\nClosed depression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that these are paired mirror images, e.g. a closed depression is the opposite of a crest. Each morphological type extends to a break of slope or point of 0-curvature.\nSlopes can be further refined by including information about their relationship to their neighbouring elements. Up and down slope, four options are available.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.2: Slope element relative inclination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nX\nWaxing\nelement upslope is gentler, element downslope is steeper.\n\n\nN\nWaning\nelement upslope is steeper, element downslope is gentler.\n\n\nA\nMaximal\nelement upslope is gentler, element downslope is gentler.\n\n\nI\nMinimal\nelement upslope is steeper, element downslope is steeper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree more are available across the slope.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.3: Slope element relative enclosure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nL\nEnclosed\nAdjacent slope elements face towards each other\n\n\nE\nExposed\nAdjacent slope elements face away from each other\n\n\nO\nOpen\nAdjacent slope elements face the same direction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis combination of properties gives rise to more complex shapes. For example, an open hollow could be described as an enclosed maximal slope (L-A-SL). A shoulder would be an exposed waxing slope (E-X-SL). Adding further information about slope and aspect, once classified, can define a complete element. For instance a gently sloping, northeast facing fan - GE NE E N SL.\n\nTODO add graphics\n\n\n\n4.2.4 Slope length\nThe length of a slope element is measured downslope, and provides information on…\n\nmention RUSLE connection\n\n\n\n4.2.5 Mesoscale topographic index\nThe Mesoscale Topographic Index (MTI) (Hurst and Allen 2007, 32) is a measure of how sheltered or exposed a location is within a landscape. To measure in the field, use a compass and clinometer to measure angle to the horizon at the 8 cardinal compass bearings. Record positive values if looking up and negative when looking down. The index formula is then (average)/-1, with high values signifying a sheltered area and low values signifying exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe closest automated equivalents of the MTI appear to be the ‘Morphometric Protection Index’ (MPI) as implemented in SAGA-GIS (Yokoyama, Shirasawa, and Pike 2002; Conrad et al. 2015), and the ‘intensity’ output of the ‘Geomorphons’ module as implemented in GRASS-GIS (Jasiewicz and Stepinski 2013; GRASS Development Team 2023). In the case of geomorphon intensity, the output also reports the mean relative elevation in meters of the 8 defining points rather than their average angles above or below the central point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField and computer-based measurement of MTI may differ slightly. The in-field version measures against magnetic north rather than ‘map north’, which will vary with spatial data projection.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.6 Active geomorphic agents\n\neroded vs aggraded then types\n\n\n\n4.2.7 Landform description\n\nshortcut terms, noting that they don’t form a conceptual tesselation\nlongform descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\nConrad, O., B.

However, the method has precision limits and requires careful user calibration.\nLaboratory particle size measurement can involve measurements of particle shape and mineralogy but these methods are labour-intensive and generally confined to a research context. High-throughput analyses confine themselves to assessment of particle size alone, making assumptions about shape and mineralogy (see Loveland and Whalley, 2000, for a more detailed discussion.)\nParticle size analysis usually involves removal of organic materials and soluble minerals as well as more aggressive aggregate dispersion using shaking and chemical solutions. Following dispersion, measurements of 3-8 specific size fractions are recorded. These data are then summarised into a three part sand/silt/clay composition.\nThe boundaries of these three size fractions are somewhat unsettled. The silt-clay boundary aligns with some major changes in particle properties; chief among them the emergence of electrostatic behaviour in the clay fraction. The sand/silt boundary can range from 0.02-0.063um. See Table 13.1 for the fractions used in NZ and other jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.1: Size fraction limits: New Zealand and elsewhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJurisdiction\nSand\nSilt\nClay\n\n\n\n\nNew Zealand, UK\n&lt; 2.0 mm\n&lt; 0.06 mm\n&lt; 0.002 mm\n\n\nAustralia\n&lt; 2.0 mm\n&lt; 0.02 mm\n&lt; 0.002 mm\n\n\nUSA, Canada\n&lt; 2.0 mm\n&lt; 0.05 mm\n&lt; 0.002 mm\n\n\nGlobal\n&lt; 2.0 mm\n&lt; 0.063 mm\n&lt; 0.002 mm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.1.2 Texture classes\nSand/silt/clay compositional data can be displayed on a triangle plot (see Figure 13.1), and domains within the plot, or ‘texture classes’, are labelled for ease of communication. It is important to remember that these classes do not have sharp changes in hand-feel texture at their boundaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.1: New Zealand Soil Texture Triangle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.2: New Zealand Texture Triangle class names and compositional limits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nClay range\nSilt range\nSand range\n\n\n\n\nS\nSand\n&lt; 8%\n&lt; 20%\n≥ 80%\n\n\nLS\nLoamy Sand\n&lt; 8%\n≥ 12 - &lt; 40%\n≥ 52 - &lt; 80%\n\n\nSL\nSandy Loam\n≥ 8 - &lt; 18%\n0 - &lt; 40%\n≥ 42 - &lt; 92%\n\n\nLZ\nLoamy Silt\n&lt; 18%\n≥ 40 - &lt; 82%\n&lt; 60%\n\n\nZ\nSilt\n&lt; 18%\n≥ 82%\n&lt; 18%\n\n\nSC\nSandy Clay Loam\n≥ 18 - &lt; 35%\n&lt;15%\n≥ 50 - &lt; 82%\n\n\nCL\nClay Loam\n≥ 18 - &lt; 35%\n≥ 15 - &lt; 40%\n≥ 25 - &lt; 67%\n\n\nZL\nSilt Loam\n≥ 18 - &lt; 35%\n≥ 40 - &lt; 82%\n&lt; 42%\n\n\nLC\nLoamy Clay\n≥ 35 - &lt; 60%\n&lt; 30%\n≥ 10 - &lt; 65%\n\n\nZC\nSilty Clay\n≥ 35 - &lt; 60%\n≥ 30 - &lt; 65 %\n&lt; 35%\n\n\nC\nClay\n≥ 60%\n&lt; 40%\n&lt; 40%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.1.2.1 Sand modifiers\nHand-texture classes can be accompanied by additional information about the sand fraction. These codes can be appended to a texture class as a prefix, e.g. (K)LS for coarse loamy sand.\nNote that appreciable coarse sand in a sample leads to underestimates of clay content in hand texturing.\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.3: Sand fraction qualifiers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nK\nCoarse\nSand is dominantly 2.0 - 0.6 mm\n\n\nM\nMedium\nSand is dominantly 0.6 - 0.2 mm\n\n\nF\nFine\nSand is dominantly 0.2 - 0.06 mm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.1.2.2 Organics modifiers\nHand-texture classes can also be modified to express the presence of elevated soil organic matter and its degree of decomposition (where it remains below the cutoff for organic soil materials). These codes can be appended to a texture class as a suffix, e.g. SL(T) for slightly organic sandy loam, or SL(TF) for slightly organic, fibric sandy loam.\nEither of the organic matter abundance qualifiers can be used to signify the ‘peaty topsoil’ NZSC diagnostic.\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.4: Organic matter qualifiers - amount\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nT\nSlightly organic\n17-30% organic matter\n\n\nP\nModerately organic\n30-50% organic matter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.5: Organic matter qualifiers - decomposition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nF\nFibric\nOrganic matter weakly decomposed and dominated by visible plant remains\n\n\nM\nMesic\nOrganic matter moderately decomposed, some visible plant structures but mostly amorphous\n\n\nH\nHumic\nOrganic matter no longer identifiable, minimal fibre content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.1.3 Particle size estimate\nEstimating particle size in the field involves compensating for the influences described above and arriving at estimates of sand and clay content (silt can be determined by difference). Record estimated clay and sand to the nearest whole percent. Optionally, add a separate error estimate (+/- x%) as an expression of confidence.",

It is black to reddish brown or dark red in colour, and a black upper part can often be distinguished from a reddish brown lower part. It lies roughly parallel to the soil surface but is commonly wavy or convolute. A Bfm horizon usually occurs as a single pan but in places it can be bifurcated. It forms a barrier to most roots and restricts water movement.\nThe Bfm horizon is equivalent to the concept of the placic horizon (Soil Survey Staff 1975) except that New Zealand ironpans are enriched in iron and organic matter without significant accumulations of manganese (Clayden et al. 1990).\n\n\nBw\nWeathered\n\na moist chroma of 4 or more but less than 6, and\n&lt;  2% redox segregations.\n\n\n\nBh\nHumose\nDark-coloured B horizon of podzolised soils enriched in organic matter, associated with aluminium, or iron and aluminium, as a result of illuviation.\nIt has a moist value and chroma of 3 or less, or a value of 4 if chroma is 2, dominant in the matrix, and contains 1% or more organic carbon. The fabric has sand- or silt- size pellet-like aggregates, coats on mineral grains, or both. In some horizons (including humus-pans, Bhm), coatings have coalesced to fill pores and cement the horizon.\n\n\nBo\nOchreous\nA strongly weathered B horizon formed in mixed crystalline iron and aluminium oxides and kaolin minerals, with low activity clay properties. It must meet all the following requirements:\n\nWeak primary ped and soil strength at moist to dry soil water states.\nUnconfined failure is friable or very friable over very moist to dry soil water states. Materials fail to predominantly 3 mm or smaller microaggregates comprising silt- and sand-sized polyhedra and spheroids.\nPrimary peds slake rapidly in water to stable microaggregates which show no or slight dispersion after 100 inversions using the method of (McQueen 1981).\nNegative reaction to the sodium fluoride test (Fieldes and Perrott 1966).\n\nBo horizons are clayey with measured clay contents commonly exceeding 60%. Measured clay % is usually larger than in overlying A horizons, but clay increase is not a defining criterion due to the difficulties of clay measurement in materials that are frequently difficult to disperse. Materials are only slightly sticky and plastic in relation to clay content. Clay coatings are either absent or only present at frequencies of about 1%. The Bo horizon has low activity clay accessory properties with ECEC and CEC less than 12 and 16 me.100 g clay respectively.\n\n\nBs\nSesquioxides\nOchreous B horizon of podzolised soils containing illuvial aluminium, iron, or both, that is closely associated, or complexed, with illuvial organic matter. The aluminium and iron is apparently mainly present as minerals with short-range order (especially allophane and ferrihydrite), though some aluminium is often present as aluminium-humus.\nThe designation Bs should be used for B horizons that:\n\noccur below an Ea, Bh, Bfm or a strongly acid A horizon, and\nhave a moist value and chroma both of more than 3, and\nhave a rapid positive reaction to the sodium fluoride test.\n\nIt is not possible to define the morphology of a Bs horizon such that it can be distinguished from certain Bw horizons enriched in iron and aluminium due to weathering in situ.\nCharacteristic features of Bs horizons are:\n\nReddest hue and highest chroma at the top of the horizon.\nEarthy apedal fabric with fine spheroids, or weakly developed blocks or polyhedrons.\nVery weak or moderately weak soil strength when moist or dry.\nA greasy or smeary feel when very moist.\nLow plasticity in relation to clay content.\nSand- or silt-size pellet-like aggregates, sesquioxidic coats on mineral grains or both.\n\n\n\nBt\nTranslocated\nB horizon containing translocated clay. It is required to have\n\nclay coatings that have a waxy lustre when dry and/or sufficient thickness to envelop fine sand grains, on ped faces or in pores, lamellae, or forming bridges between mineral grains, or\nif there is an overlying E or AE horizon with no lithological discontinuity at its base, sufficiently more clay than the eluvial horizon to be detectable by hand texturing (i.e. 5% more clay).\n\n\n\nBw\nWeathered\nB horizon that shows evidence of alteration under well aerated conditions and does not qualify as Bh, Bs or Bt.\nTo qualify as a Bw rather than BC or C it must meet at least one of the following requirements:\n\nRedder hue or higher chroma than an underlying horizon in similar materials (‘colour B’).\nHave spheroids, blocks, polyhedrons, tablets, prisms, columns or plates which distinguish the horizon from a BC or C horizon below (‘structural B’).\nEvidence of either partial or complete decalcification, i.e. less CaCO3 than the underlying horizon which may contain redeposited carbonates.\n\nA Bw horizon has less than 2% redox segregations. It is otherwise distinguished by the following colour requirements:\n\nWith moist values less than 5, chromas must be 3 or more.\nWith moist values 5 or more, chromas must be 4 or more.\n\n\n\nBC\nB-ish\nA horizon transitional in character between a B and a C horizon, usually below a B horizon. It is distinguished from a B horizon in similar material by lacking some required characteristic of colour, pedality or degree of weathering. It differs from a C horizon by having some B horizon feature, albeit weakly expressed. The same designation is also applied to morphologically similar subsurface horizons in profiles without a B horizon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.2.5 C Horizons\n\n\n\n\nTable 21.6: Secondary C horizon divisions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCR\nConsolidated\nA weakly consolidated C horizon that is sufficiently dense and coherent to form a significant barrier to roots. Soft rocks (with a hardness on Moh's scale of &lt; 3) such as shale and siltstone, and some exceptionally dense glacial tills are included. The material can be dug with difficulty with a spade when moist. The concept of the CR horizon is similar to that of the material underlying a paralithic contact, but without the restrictive requirement for the spacing of cracks.\n\n\nCu\nUnconsolidated\nUnconsolidated C horizon without evidence of strong gleying, accumulation of carbonates or more soluble salts. It is normally apedal, may show stratification and has less than 2% redox segregations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.2.6 R Horizons\n\n\n\n\nTable 21.7: Secondary R horizon divisions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nR\nRock\nHard or very hard bedrock that is impracticable to dig with a spade.

It has dark coloured coats on ped faces, in pores and on rock fragments. The coats have a moist value of 4 or less, or value 5 and chroma 3, and are assumed to be a complex of organic matter with clay and/or sesquioxides. Similar features are described as organic coatings by Bullock, Fedoroff, and Jongerius (1985) and as\n\n\ni\nNodular\nTo denote that the horizon contains more than 15% by volume of nodules, subrounded or irregular segregations of iron or aluminium oxyhydroxides with some kaolin.\n\n\nj\nJarositic\nTo denote the presence of straw-coloured jarosite, most commonly in *g or *r horizons.\n\n\nk\nCalcareous\nTo denote an accumulation of secondary carbonate, CaCO3.\n\n\nl\nGibbsitic\nTo denote an accumulation of gibbsite, Al(OH)3.\n\n\nm\nCemented\nTo denote a continuously cemented horizon that is strong enough to resist root penetration.\n\n\nn\nSodic\nTo denote an accumulation of sodium (identified in the field).\n\n\nq\nSilicic\nTo denote an accumulation of secondary silica.

Assign one of the classes in Table 23.8 to each horizon. Note that ‘xs’ represents effective impermeability. The classes have been slightly simplified from those in Griffiths (1991) and Griffiths et al (1999).\nPermeability is very difficult to assess in the field, but considerable work has been done to associate particular ranges of values with the components of the functional horizon. As such, each functional horizon has a default permeability class and usually one or more additional allowable classes. Use the functional horizon name to narrow down the appropriate choice of permeability rating, per Table 23.9 below.\n\n\n\n\nTable 23.8: Horizon-level permeability classes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nxs\nExtremely slow\n&lt; 0.1 mm/h\n\n\ns\nSlow\n0.1 - 4 mm/h\n\n\nms\nModerately slow\n4 - 18 mm/h\n\n\nm\nModerate\n18 - 72 mm/h\n\n\nr\nRapid\n&gt; 72 mm/h",

    "text": "23.3 Horizon drainage\nSoil drainage is an assessment of how fast water leaves a soil profile relative to supply. This characteristic can be controlled by morphological characteristics that occur in a range of combinations.\nDrainage should first be assessed on a per-horizon basis. These interpretations are later summarised at a profile level (see Section 28.4). Table 23.10 below highlights the common characteristics associated with each horizon drainage class. A ‘balance of evidence’ approach should be taken when assigning a drainage class to a horizon.

When otherwise in doubt, a well developed A horizon should be assigned a drainage class one better than the horizon below it (usually a B, E, or C horizon). A poorly developed A horizon should receive the same class assignment as the horizon below. Use the ‘distinct topsoil’ NZSC diagnostic criteria to identify well developed A horizons.\nThe reasoning behind this rule of thumb is that the lack of topsoil development may be partially explained by lack of contrast in the drainage regime between the topsoil and the layer below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoils that are persistently wet may also become anoxic. This is more common in low-permeability soils, where slow percolation allows enough time for oxygen to be consumed entirely. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGriffiths, E. 1991. “Assessing Soil Permeability Class from Soil Morphology.” Havelock North, New Zealand. http://digitallibrary.landcareresearch.co.nz.landcareresearch.idm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p20022coll26/id/2/rec/23.\n\n\nGriffiths, E., T.

Both contributing layers must be at least 20 cm thick.\nWhen there are more than two texture layers within the control section, then the texture profile is identified according to the uppermost texture contrast.\n\nFor example, if a sandy horizon occurs at 80 cm depth and a clayey horizon overlays a silty horizon at 40 cm, then the texture contrast is reported as clayey over silty (c/z) and the sandy layer is ignored.\n\nSilty and loamy horizons are not considered contrasting and can be added together where contiguous.\n\nFor example, a profile with silty (0–15 cm) over loamy (15–25 cm) over sandy (25-90 cm) is considered to have a contrasting upper layer of 25 cm, and is identified as silty over sandy (z/s). The texture specification uses the uppermost of the silty or loamy layers together with the lower layer.\n\nSkeletal horizons (k) may only be used for Ms, Mm, Mt and So soils.

    "text": "28.4 Drainage\nProfile drainage is built from horizon drainage ratings completed according to Section 23.3.\n\nThe dominant drainage class in each of the control sections in Table 28.4 forms a sequence, e.g. ‘WE-WE-MW-MW-IP’. Each of these sequences is unique to a profile drainage class - in the case of this example, ‘MW’.\nAny sequence where the drainage class does not change (e.g. PO-PO-PO-PO-PO) will also be PO at profile level.\nFor shallower profiles, the drainage sequence stops early. For example, with a 25 cm profile over rock, one might get the sequence WE-MW-XX-XX-XX. That sequence can occur in the MW, IP and PO profile ratings, but since the IP and PO classes are not identified at horizon level, MW must be chosen at profile level.\nFor perched profiles, sequences like IP-PO-PO-WE-WE might be identified, where the perching layer prevents development of poor-drainage diagnostic features below. In this case, when classifying drainage, one must stop at the base of the perched layer, as if it were a shallow profile, ignoring the ‘improvement’ in drainage below this point.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 28.4: Profile drainage rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepth (cm)\nVery Poor\nPoor\nImperfect\nModerately Well\nWell\n\n\n\n\n0 - 15\nPO, VP\nWE, MW, IP, PO\nWE, MW, IP\nWE, MW\nWE\n\n\n15 - 30\nVP\nMW, IP, PO\nWE, MW, IP\nWE, MW\nWE\n\n\n30 - 60\nVP\nPO, VP\nIP\nWE, MW\nWE\n\n\n60 - 90\nVP\nPO, VP\nIP, PO, VP\nMW, IP, PO\nWE\n\n\n&gt; 90\nVP\nPO, VP\nIP, PO, VP\nMW, IP, PO, VP\nWE, MW, IP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkers classifying drainage for NZSC Sibling construction have no need to subdivide within those overall ratings. For other types of work e.g. agricultural suitability assessment, it may be useful to recognise subgroups – e.g. for a deep-rooted, wetness-intolerant crop, there’s a difference between an imperfectly drained profile that’s WE-IP-IP-IP-PO vs WE-IP-IP-PO-PO.\n\n28.4.1 Helper information for profile drainage\nTable 28.5 describes some potential additional signifiers of profile drainage condition that might be considered. These may be useful when estimating drainage in a new landscape that has not yet been examined in detail, or when handling edge cases where a particular control section has ambiguous horizon-level drainage.\n\n\n\n\nTable 28.5: Profile drainage signifiers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nElevation above local drainage\nLandform\nSlope\nVegetation\nOther\n\n\n\n\nVP\nVery poor\nVery low (0-1m)\nWaning/minimal/enclosed flats and depressions\nLevel to very gentle\nExclusively wetland plants\nPersistent surface water ponding or seeps nearby\n\n\nPO\nPoor\nLow (0-10m)\nWaning/minimal slopes and flats\nLow-slope or level ground\nWetland plants\nSeasonal ponding or seeps nearby\n\n\nIP\nImperfect\nVariable\nSlopes, hollows, flats\nGentle to moderately steep\nAny\nMore common below high dropoffs\n\n\nMW\nModerately Well\nVariable\nMost landforms\nGentle to moderately steep\nAny\n\n\n\nWE\nWell\nModerate to high (&gt;10 m)\ncrests, ridges and spurs\nGentle to very steep\nAny, dry-tolerant may outcompete\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28.4.2 Natural vs Artificial drainage\nProfile drainage is often modified by human activity.
