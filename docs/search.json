    "text": "1.1 Foreword to the second edition\nThe intent of updating the New Zealand soil description handbook is to produce a document that can describe a soil profile and its landscape context in a way that effectively informs agronomic, ecological, and research applications. This includes, but is not limited to, applications like\nEngineering applications are considered out of scope, but relationships can and should be drawn between this standard and e.g., International and New Zealand geotechnical standards.\nThe document aims to support the requirements of the NZ Soil Classification, and, wherever possible, be compatible with international soil description and classification standards.\nThe revised edition of the Soil Description Handbook Milne et al. (1995) has been a steady companion to the New Zealand pedologist for nearly thirty years. This should tell us something very complimentary about the quality of the original publication! Nonetheless, as time marches on, elements of the standard have become out of date and require a refresh - notably, a response to the ever-advancing use of technology in the field. Additionally, the structure and layout of the book make it somewhat challenging to develop it into a structured database capable of storing, analysing and publishing high quality soils data.\nThis update has been in the works for over five years, but has unfortunately struggled to compete with the pressing demands of our soil mapping and research workload. The past year involved a major push to get the new draft into a stable enough state that external review is now possible. A summary of the changes proposed can be seen in Appendix F. We expect the draft to continue to evolve into a final document that suits not only Manaaki Whenua’s expert pedologists, but soils workers throughout New Zealand.\nThis new draft edition of the Handbook was compiled by Lauren O’Brien, in consultation with Andre Eger, Balin Robertson, Kirstin Deuss, Thomas Caspari, Veronica Penny, Lena Reifschneider, Scott Fraser, Emily Mackay, Anthony Ward, Malcolm McLeod, Trevor Webb, and Ian Lynn. The project would not have been possible without the support of Sam Carrick, Linda Lilburne and Andrew Manderson.\nLauren O’Brien Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research 2024-11-17",

    "text": "The soil profiles that pedologists describe are components of a larger landscape, and both influence and are influenced by their surrounds. To bring structure to the information we gather about the profile surrounds, the available inputs can be grouped into ‘soil forming factors’. These are commonly conceptualised in soils literature using the ‘clorpt’ model, whereby soils are considered to be a product of interactions of Climate, Organisms, Relief, Parent Material and Time (Jenny 1941). This section is loosely organised around these factors and describes where information on them can be found (specific to the New Zealand context) and certain parameters that may (or must) be measured directly in the field.\n\n\n\n\nJenny H 1941.

    "text": "3.1.1 Recording location\nLocations are recorded using a coordinate reference system (CRS), which defines a grid over the land surface. Geographic coordinate systems use angular coordinates (degrees latitude and longitude) and model the earth as a sphere or ellipsoid. Projected coordinate systems, per the name, project all or part of the earth’s surface onto a flat plane by various methods, allowing use of linear coordinates (e.g. meters). Different types of projection have different strengths and weaknesses around preservation of distance and direction accuracy. Elevation can also be determined from a global model, or a locally calibrated one.\nIn New Zealand, the official projected coordinate reference system is New Zealand Transverse Mercator (EPSG:2193). Elevation is defined with reference to the New Zealand Vertical Datum 2016 (EPSG:1169). For more information on these systems, see LINZ (2025a).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 3.1: EPSG codes\n\n\n\n\n\nThe full definition of a coordinate reference system comprises a long, structured list of parameters. To make it easier to refer to a specific set of these parameters, the EPSG database was established in the 1980s, giving commonly used parameter sets a short identifier. The database is maintained by the Geodesy Subcommittee of the IOGP Geomatics Committee and can be most easily accessed at epsg.io.\n\n\n\nLocation accuracy is largely a function of the equipment available and the quality of data recording (see Section 3.1.3). For soil survey work, location precision must be recorded to a minimum of 3 m but does not need to exceed 1 m for pits, or 0.1 m for cores and auger holes. Elevation precision will rarely need to exceed 0.1 m.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Example location: 1586090E, 5405722N (462 m)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning 3.1: Use of WGS84\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation sensors default to the global longitude-latitude based WGS84 datum (EPSG:4326). As a global system, its maximum accuracy is around ± 3 m, and its accuracy decreases over time due to continental drift and other tectonic events. This is compensated for using a periodic ‘epoch’ adjustment. Additionally, elevation data will not be accurate until it is converted into a local elevation datum.\nBecause of these limitations, WGS84 should only be used when reconciling data from multiple locations on a global scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning 3.2: Alternate geocoding systems\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternate geocoding systems involving e.g. text-based encoding or nested hashes should not be used during fieldwork. These systems are often proprietary, sometimes prone to ambiguity or edge-case errors, and at their core often wrap around WGS84 anyway. They may still be useful during data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Expected error\nExpected error can be automatically reported by equipment, or estimated. When estimating horizontal error, record in metres with a maximum precision of 0.01 (1 cm) e.g. ± 5.12 m. Record estimated vertical elevation error separately in the same units, as it will differ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 3.2: Revising locations\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth on-ground photographs and high-resolution satellite imagery can sometimes help improve site location accuracy by showing the location of the site relative to nearby features. Satellite imagery must be precisely geolocated to be effective at this task, or the site will only be correct in relation to the image used and not to the true location. Photographs also need to be taken in a particular way to be useful for this task (see Section B.3).\nWhere corrections are made, expected error from the measuring instrument should be overridden with a new manual estimate of expected error. Document how and why the revision decision was made.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Equipment and data sources\nUse a GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) with an expected horizontal accuracy of ± 3 m or better. Some applications may require centimetre accuracy. Sensor type can be recorded using one of the codes in Table 3.1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Location data sources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nGS\nSingle-band GNSS\nSatellite based location, single band\n\n\nGM\nMulti-band GNSS\nSatellite based location, multiple band\n\n\nGR\nDifferential GNSS\nSatellite based location, on-ground correction\n\n\nLM\nMulti-sensor\nCombined GNSS and other location data\n\n\nNO\nNone\nLocation determined manually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 3.1: GNSS types\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-constellation GNSS is not the same as multi-band GNSS. The former signifies access to multiple location satellite networks operated by various parties, e.g. GPS (USA), Galileo (EU), BeiDou (China). Multi-constellation GNSS can improve signal consistency due to having access to more total satellites, but not necessarily overall accuracy.\nMulti-band GNSS involves receiving signals from location satellites on multiple frequency bands. The extra data from each satellite can significantly improve connection reliability and accuracy, particularly when open sky is restricted by rough terrain, dense vegetation or poor weather.\nMulti-sensor GNSS involves receiving signals not just from location satellites, but also from other on-ground equipment, such as mobile phone towers, Wi-Fi routers and nearby personal electronic devices. These sensors can be extremely accurate in urban areas, but much less so elsewhere.\nMost consumer electronic devices capable of reporting location, such as mobile phones, will be of LM type by default, unless using an app that actively forces a GNSS-only connection. At the time of writing, most of these apps can still only return GS-quality data due to hardware limitations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 3.3: Manual locations\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimating location manually using topographic maps and orienteering methods remains an option, but should usually be considered a last resort.\n\n\n\nParts of New Zealand still lack highly accurate elevation data. Recording the elevation measurement method using one of the codes in Table 3.2 below helps provide an estimate of confidence in the elevation data.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Elevation data sources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\n\n\n\n\nD\nExtracted from high-accuracy Digital Terrain Model (DTM) e.g. Lidar-based\n\n\nG\nMeasured using a GNSS system with an adequate 3D fix\n\n\nM\nExtracted from a low-accuracy DTM\n\n\nA\nMeasured by a calibrated altimeter\n\n\nE\nEstimated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD type elevation measurements, for example data extracted from high resolution public datasets like LINZ (2025b), offer the best accuracy currently available in New Zealand usually around ± 0.2 m. Global satellite-derived datasets like those available on Open Topography (https://opentopography.org) may offer comparable accuracy at a larger cell size and extend across some areas where lidar data is not yet available.\nG type elevation measurements are unlikely to be accurate if not using a GR-type sensor (see Section 3.1.3), and may require additional conversion to the New Zealand Vertical Datum. However, some specialist GNSS systems can achieve elevation accuracies exceeding ± 0.01 m.\nThe M code should be used for most non-Lidar DEMs, as those available for public use were constructed from interpolated contour data or other methods with comparable vertical accuracy (see Barringer et al. 2002; Uuemaa et al. 2020). M DEMs can be off by over 10 m in some areas, e.g valley floors where small landscape features are not captured (Barringer et al. 2002).\nWhere the A code is used, the time and location of the most recent altimeter calibration should be noted. Handheld altimeters can be expected to be accurate to within ± 3 m.\nE estimated elevations might include interpolation from a contour map with interval of &gt; 20 m, or a ‘best guess’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 3.4: DEMs and location\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere DEMs are used, they should be as contemporary as possible; New Zealand’s rate of landscape evolution is relatively fast and these data sources will become less reliable with age. DEMs more than 20 years old should be accompanied by a vertical error estimate adjusted upwards for age.",

    "text": "3.2 Relative location\nAbsolute locations are enhanced by information about what is nearby. This context is useful for checking that a site’s coordinates are correct and for revisiting a site in future.\n\n3.2.1 Triangulating off local features\nAbsolute location data can be backed up by measuring to nearby permanent or long-term features. This practice is particularly useful for relocating long-term monitoring plots. For this to work well, features should be within ~50 m of the target location and sufficiently sturdy to last until at least the next expected visit. Examples include fencelines, buildings, roads, and rock outcrops.\nFor single-point sites, measure distance and direction using a tape and compass. Accuracy is improved by measuring to two or more features. For plot-based sites, one can measure from at least two corners to the target feature. Photographing the point/plot and reference points together is also useful (see Section B.3 for guidance on field photography).\nadd a diagram here\n\n\n3.2.2 Recording relative elevation\nElevation above the nearest down-slope drainage (open/flowing water, swampy ground, or a closed depression) is useful for landscape interpretations. The data can also be used to group profile descriptions, for instance when identifying sets of related terraces along river systems. The drainage feature to record against must be identified by tracing a path down-slope from the observation point, and may be far from the point of observation. As such, it will normally be more efficient to estimate this parameter after fieldwork using elevation and imagery data.\nRecord relative elevation in metres, with a precision of no more than 0.01 (1 cm), e.g. 25.53 m.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 3.5: Relative elevation models\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a sufficiently detailed DEM and stream network data, a Relative Elevation Model (REM) can be constructed to estimate this parameter. The result will need to be ground-truthed. See Greco et al. (2008) and Olson et al. (2014) for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Recording access details\nFor observation points that will be revisited, record practical information about how to return. This may include landholder contact details and records of previous interactions, notes about track conditions, locked gates, and potential hazards like water crossings. Spatial data recording the track from the nearest public road to the target location is particularly valuable.\n\n\n3.2.4 Recording administrative location\nTagging sites with their administrative region(s) can help with discoverability (searching and filtering) in databases, and simplify information security and privacy arrangements. Tagging does not need to be done in the field, provided accurate locations are recorded.\nIn New Zealand, relevant boundaries include Regional Council (Stats NZ 2023a) and Territorial Authority (District Council, Stats NZ (2023b)) areas.

Geomorphology can be described at multiple scales, which break down into progressively simpler shapes. The system described in this chapter helps the pedologist to do that consistently. In this system, the chosen scales are Province (Section 4.1), Landscape (Section 4.2), and Landform (Section 4.3) as described below. Some additional, highly local geomorphology parameters are captured when describing the land surface at a site (Chapter 11).\nProvinces identify major geomorphic zones in New Zealand, expressive of large-scale lithological associations, tectonic regime, and climate. Table 4.1 lists their names and Figure 4.1 shows their general distribution. Full definitions of the provinces are in Appendix G.\nGiven their very broad extent, province does not need to be recorded in the field.

    "text": "4.2 Landscape\nThe landscape around a soil observation comprises a distinct geomorphological pattern with repeating elements. The scale of observation varies but commonly extends from a few hundred to a few thousand meters (Heck 2017). Landscapes nest within Provinces but are not exclusive to one or another.\n\n4.2.1 Parameterising landscapes\nA landscape can be described in terms of a short list of parameters: relief, characteristic slope, drainage pattern, and the landforms contained within the landscape.\n\n4.2.1.1 Relief\nRelief is the degree of separation between high and low points in a landscape. As described in National Committee on Soil and Terrain (2024, p. 36), relief can be visualised by picturing two surfaces roughly parallel to the land surface - one passing through local crests and one through local depressions. The median vertical distance between the two surfaces is the relief.\nadd a diagram here\nRelief is usually best determined from a DEM, but can be estimated in the field. Record in whole meters if estimating, e.g. 55 m. Relief classes may be applied to the recorded data; see Section E.1.3.\n\n\n4.2.1.2 Characteristic slope\nThe characteristic slope is the most common range of slopes within a regional landscape. These are often controlled by local geology.\nCharacteristic slope is usually best determined from zonal analysis of a DEM-derived slope dataset, but can be estimated in the field. Estimate in the field as a median and range, in whole degrees, e.g. 25° (20-28). Slope classes may be applied to the recorded data; some options are presented in Section E.1.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 4.1: Multiple characteristic slopes\n\n\n\n\n\nSome landscapes may have two or more distinct characteristic slopes, e.g. the fronts and tops of alluvial terrace elements. In this case the median will describe the dominant surface while the range will capture the steeper areas. Recording multiple characteristic slopes at landscape scale is not considered useful, as adequate context is provided by naming the landscape and its component landforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1.3 Stream channels\nNatural stream channel patterns are relevant to understanding landscape development, but are best observed remotely. They do not need to be recorded in the field. If desired, assess the landscape drainage pattern using available data sources and define it using the stream channel attributes given in (2024, p. 38–41).\n\n\n4.2.1.4 Landscape description\nFew controlled vocabularies for landscapes exist. The schema given in Table 4.2 below is provisional and based on terms seen in common use in New Zealand environmental datasets.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.2: Common Landscape terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\nSynonyms and subtypes\n\n\n\n\nMt\nMountains\nSteep to very steep, high relief (&gt;300 m), fixed and well connected stream channels, often deep\nAlps, Volcanoes, Mountain country\n\n\nHi\nHills\nGentle to very steep, moderately high to high relief (90-300 m), fixed and well connected stream channels, shallow to deep\nHillscapes, hill country, hilly land\n\n\nUp\nUplands\nGentle to very steep, low relief (30-90 m) but relatively high elevation, fixed and well connected stream channels, shallow valleys and plateaus, located among hills and mountains\nPiedmont\n\n\nLl\nLowlands\nGentle to very steep, low relief (30-90 m) and elevation, fixed and well connected stream channels, shallow to deep\nDownlands\n\n\nTe\nTerraces\nFormer plains, uplifted and sometimes covered by loess.

Slope classes may be applied to the recorded data; some options are presented in Section E.1.1.\n\n\n4.3.2.2 Orientation\nFor simpler sloping landforms, record orientation as the characteristic aspect of the major part of the landform. Record median and range in whole degrees, e.g. 315 (300-330) for a roughly northwest direction. For complex landforms with a range of aspects, record the orientation of the landform’s longest axis, looking downslope (e.g. the direction in which a valley bottom is descending). Some landforms may not have an identifiable orientation (e.g. cones, saddles), in which case record NA.\nAspect classes may be applied to the recorded data; some options are presented in Section E.1.2.\n\n\n4.3.2.3 Landform element\nThe following is adapted from (2024, p. 19–25).\nA landform element is the simplest component of a landform, and some landforms are made up of only one element. Landform elements are first assigned to a morphological type - one of a series of simple shapes - at the scale of observation. These are given in Table 4.4 below.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.4: Landform Element Morphologies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCr\nCrest\nA local high area\n\n\nRi\nRidge\nA linear high area\n\n\nSl\nSlope\nA sloping area\n\n\nFl\nFlat\nA non-sloping area\n\n\nDo\nOpen depression\na linear low area\n\n\nDc\nClosed depression\na locally low area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that these are paired mirror images, e.g. a closed depression is the opposite of a crest. Each morphological type extends to a break of slope or point of 0-curvature.\nSlopes can be further refined by including information about their relationship to their neighbouring elements. Up and down slope, four options are available.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.5: Slope element relative inclination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nX\nWaxing\nElement upslope is gentler, element downslope is steeper.\n\n\nN\nWaning\nElement upslope is steeper, element downslope is gentler.\n\n\nA\nMaximal\nElement upslope is gentler, element downslope is gentler.\n\n\nI\nMinimal\nElement upslope is steeper, element downslope is steeper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree more are available across the slope.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.6: Slope element relative enclosure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nL\nEnclosed\nAdjacent slope elements face towards each other\n\n\nE\nExposed\nAdjacent slope elements face away from each other\n\n\nO\nOpen\nAdjacent slope elements face the same direction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis combination of properties gives rise to more complex shapes. For example, an open hollow could be described as an enclosed maximal slope (SL A L). A shoulder would be an exposed waxing slope (SL X E). Adding further information about slope and aspect can define a complete element. For instance, for a gently sloping, northeast facing fan - 5 40 SL N E.\nTODO add graphics",

    "text": "4.4 Other terrain parameters\nThe following terrain parameters may be useful in particular contexts.\n\n4.4.1 Slope length\nSlope length is used in assessments of erosion vulnerability. Length is measured from the point at which a slope becomes steep enough to lose soil to erosion processes (see Section 11.8.1), to where it levels out enough to receive soils (or to a drainage channel). This is usually impractical to measure in the field, but can be determined computationally given an appropriately detailed DEM. Alternatively, the slope length can be manually traced in GIS.\n\n\n4.4.2 Mesoscale topographic index\nThe Mesoscale Topographic Index (MTI, Hurst et al. (2022), p. 15) is a measure of how sheltered or exposed a location is within a landscape. To measure in the field, use a compass and clinometer to measure angle to the horizon at the 8 cardinal compass bearings. Record positive values if looking up and negative when looking down. The average of the eight values defines the index, with high values signifying a sheltered area and low values signifying exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 4.1: Automating the MTI\n\n\n\n\n\nThe closest automated equivalents of the MTI appear to be the ‘Morphometric Protection Index’ (MPI) as implemented in SAGA-GIS (Yokoyama et al. 2002; Conrad et al. 2015), and the ‘intensity’ output of the ‘Geomorphons’ module as implemented in GRASS-GIS (Jasiewicz and Stepinski 2013; GRASS Development Team 2023). In the case of geomorphon intensity, the output also reports the mean relative elevation in meters of the 8 defining points rather than their average angles above or below the central point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning 4.1: Field vs Computer MTI\n\n\n\n\n\nField and computer-based measurement of MTI may differ slightly. The in-field version measures against magnetic north rather than ‘map north’, which will vary with spatial data projection.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Terrain shape index\nTerrain shape index (TSI, Hurst et al. (2022), p. 15) is a localised version of MTI, where slope angles are measured at cardinal compass points 20 m from the point of observation, rather than to the horizon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 4.2: Automating the TSI\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TSI can also be calculated using the automated tools mentioned above, but will require a DEM with high vertical accuracy and cell size no more than 10 m.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConrad O, Bechtel B, Bock M, Dietrich H, Fischer E, Gerlitz L, Wehberg J, Wichmann V, Böhner J 2015.

Keep the following in mind:\nGeology mapping in New Zealand can be accessed through resources provided by Earth Sciences New Zealand.

This because the map units selected in geological mapping tend to reflect the underlying, large-scale deposits that have been landforming in emplacement.",

    "text": "5.2 Lithology\nThe specific mineral characteristics of the soil parent material, or its lithology, offers a more specific and soil-relevant categorisation than geology mapping generally supplies. Lithology is generally recorded when describing the soil’s fine earth fraction (mineral material &lt;2 mm), surface and in-profile rock fragments (mineral material &gt;2 mm), substrates, and profile-adjacent outcrops. Table 5.1 provides a short list of parent material lithologies compatible with the NZSC Family (Webb and Lilburne 2011).\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.1: NZSC Lithology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\n\n\n\n\nCb\nCarbonaceous Rock (Coal)\n\n\nSq\nSoft Quartzitic Sediments\n\n\nHq\nHard Quartzitic Sediments\n\n\nSm\nSoft mudstone\n\n\nSs\nSoft sandstone\n\n\nHm\nHard mudstone\n\n\nHs\nHard sandstone\n\n\nTm\nTuffaceous mudstone\n\n\nTs\nTuffaceous sandstone\n\n\nSc\nSchist\n\n\nLs\nSoft calcareous\n\n\nLi\nHard calcareous\n\n\nMa\nMarble\n\n\nRh\nRhyolite\n\n\nIg\nIgnimbrite\n\n\nAn\nAndesite\n\n\nBa\nBasalt\n\n\nGr\nGranite and Gneiss\n\n\nDi\nDiorite\n\n\nGa\nGabbro\n\n\nFe\nIron Sands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 5.1: What are soft rocks?\n\n\n\n\n\n‘Soft’ rocks in this context can at most be broken readily with a light hammer blow, and can be scraped and peeled by a pocket knife. ‘Hard’ rocks can at best be scratched with a knife but not scraped or peeled, and require a firm hammer blow to crack (Lynn and Crippen 1991, p. 11).\n\n\n\n\n5.2.1 Other lithology classifications\n\n5.2.1.1 Geological vocabularies\nSeveral research-grade vocabularies for describing geology have been developed in recent years, including Geoscience Australia (2016) and McCormick and Heaven (2023). Both offer a detailed set of rock and mineral definitions in a hierarchical relationship structure, but both are currently missing one or more terms essential to the New Zealand context. Additionally, the hierarchies don’t always align cleanly with those used in New Zealand geology. The vocabularies are expected to develop over time and may be recommended in future editions of this handbook.\nOther, simpler lithological vocabularies available in New Zealand and elsewhere often conflate lithology with mode of deposition and particle size when describing unconsolidated, transported materials (e.g. NZLRI rock types, Lynn and Crippen (1991) and WRB parent material, IUSS Working Group WRB (2022)). Parent material origin and particle size distribution are described separately for soil materials in this handbook (Section 12.8.3, Chapter 15). However, workers describing soils as part of an LUC assessment may still wish to use the NZLRI rock types list for compatibility reasons (Lynn and Crippen 1991).\n\n\n5.2.1.2 Silica-content classification\nSoil parent material classifications have largely focused on major geological origin (igneous, metamorphic, sedimentary), grain size, and some obvious compositional classes. (2016) contend that the major differentiator for soil formation should first be silica (SiO2) content and propose an alternate lithology classification on that basis.",

    "text": "6.2 Specific measurements\nSome climate parameters are more directly related to soils than others, mainly through their influence on vegetation community and evapotranspiration. Spatial estimates of these parameters have been published in the NZ Environmental Data Stack (McCarthy et al. 2021), available from the MWLR Datastore. Estimates can also be constructed from local records, where these are available.\n\n6.2.1 Rainfall\nSoil moisture availability strongly influences chemical weathering in soils (Dixon et al. 2016), and in many parts of the landscape the main source of soil moisture is rainfall.\n\nTotal annual rainfall: Some soils are unlikely to form outside a particular total annual rainfall range, e.g. Allophanic soils are uncommon where total annual rainfall is less than 1000 mm (Hewitt 2010).\nRainfall seasonality: Calculated as the mean of monthly rainfall totals, divided by their standard deviation. More pronounced seasonality implies stronger soil wetting and drying cycles, which in turn influences weathering processes.\nAn alternate measurement of seasonality involves calculating the ratio of rainfall in the warmest versus the coolest three months. In New Zealand this is usually (Dec + Jan + Feb)/(June + Jul + Aug).\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Temperature\n\nMean annual temperature: The mean temperature recorded year-round.\nMean summer temperature: The mean temperature recorded over the warmest quarter of the year. In New Zealand, this is usually December-January-February. Mean summer temperature was a key parameter used by Singers and Rogers (2014) to classify NZ terrestrial ecosystems.\nGrowing Degree Days (GDD): GDD measures the total number of °C above a set minimum temperature (usually 5, 10, or 16°C). Average daily temperature (max - min/2) is used in the calculation, and where temperature is below the set minimum, 0 is recorded. Plant species have specific GDD requirements that help determine their distribution.\nFrost Days (FD): Frost days are days where the temperature drops below 0 °C, measured 1.2 m above the land surface.\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Insolation\nThe amount of solar energy received by a site, modified by terrain and cloud cover, can strongly affect plant growth and soil weathering rates.\n\n\n6.2.4 Prevailing winds\nThe prevailing wind direction, its usual strength and seasonality all affect evapotranspiration rates and even the physical development of growing plants.",

Note that considerable botanical experience is needed to apply the full RECCE standard correctly.\nIf the soil description is being completed in the context of a Land Use Capability (LUC) assessment, use the NZLRI Vegetation Descriptions available in Appendix 3 of the LUC Handbook (Lynn et al. 2009). This system describes a set of 49 vegetation communities commonly found in New Zealand, grouped into five broad structural categories (grasses, crops, scrub, forest, and herbaceous). Ability to identify key local species will be required to apply the system correctly.

    "text": "7.2 Soil Fauna\n\n7.2.1 Megafauna\nSoil megafauna are large species that may not be directly dependant on the soil for any part of their life cycle, but still significantly and directly affect the soil, usually by mechanical disturbance or organic material addition. In New Zealand this role was largely filled by native earthworms, birds and reptiles before the arrival of humans. Since then, the niche has been dominated by domesticated sheep, goats and cows, as well as feral goats, pigs and rabbits. Significant increases in the volume of animal wastes added to many soils have also occurred, most intensely on land converted to pastoral agriculture. Introduction of exotic earthworms and dung beetle species has followed.\nThe influence of these animals is generally captured elsewhere in a soil description (e.g. Section 11.4) and so no further morphology recording requirements are defined in this handbook.\nDirect assessment of earthworm presence in the topsoil is sometimes desired (Shepherd 2000; Shepherd and Janssen 2000). Optionally, record the number of earthworms observed in a 20 x 20 cm block of A horizon. Calculate the volume of the sample examined and convert the count to a rate per cubic metre.\n\n\n7.2.2 Macrofauna\nMacrofauna are those soil-dwelling animals with a body width of ~2 - 20 mm. The influence of these animals is generally captured in a soil description as infill features (Section 12.5) or voids (Section 13.4.1). In New Zealand, soil bioturbation by macrofauna has been relatively minimal, excepting some native dung beetles.\n\n\n7.2.3 Meso- and Microfauna\nThe soil Meso- and Microfauna are much smaller, with body widths of 0.1 - 2.0 mm and &lt; 0.1 mm respectively. They live mostly within soil pores and have little direct impact on structure. Their presence, however, is a sign that soil porosity is well enough developed to provide them with a habitat. No observational requirements are defined for Meso- or Microfauna at this time.\n\n\n\n\nHurst JB, Allen RB, Fergus AJ 2022. The Recce method for describing New Zealand vegetation - a manual.

Land use is the purpose(s) for which the land is used and provides context for why a particular land cover is present. Land management describes specific activities affecting land cover, driven by land use.\nLand cover, use and management information may be captured as part of soil survey when it is relevant to interpreting the landscape, landform, site, and soil profile description, and especially where it is likely to have affected the soil classification. Land use data is particularly important for long-term monitoring sites, where uses may change significantly between sampling events.\nLand cover in New Zealand is monitored using the Land Cover Database (LCDB, Landcare Research New Zealand Ltd (2020)). The database is used to publish a semi-automated map of land cover, derived from satellite imagery, with a minimum unit size of 1 hectare. The LCDB categories can also be applied on-ground. The categories are listed below, excluding some where it would be physically impossible to observe the soil. The first six are currently mapped to over 80% of New Zealand’s land area and so are the most likely to encounter. The full set of category definitions are available in Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research (2018).\nTable 8.1: Land Cover Database categories.

Low density ‘lifestyle’ residential areas are included where hard surfaces, landscaping and gardens dominate other land covers.\n\n\n2\nUrban Parkland/Open Space\nOpen, mainly grassed or sparsely-treed, amenity, utility and recreation areas. The class includes parks and playing fields, public gardens, cemeteries, golf courses, berms and other vegetated areas usually within or associated with built-up areas.\n\n\n6\nSurface Mine or Dump\nBare surfaces arising from open-cast and other surface mining activities, quarries, gravel-pits and areas of solid waste disposal such as refuse dumps, clean-fill dumps and active reclamation sites.\n\n\n10\nSand or Gravel\nBare surfaces dominated by unconsolidated materials generally finer than coarse gravel (60 mm). Typically mapped along sandy seashores and the margins of lagoons and estuaries, lakes and rivers and some areas subject to surficial erosion, soil toxicity and extreme exposure.\n\n\n12\nLandslide\nBare surfaces arising from mass-movement erosion generally in mountain-lands and steep hill-country.\n\n\n15\nAlpine Grass/Herbfield\nTypically, sparse communities above the actual or theoretical treeline dominated by herbaceous cushion, mat, turf, and rosette plants and lichens. Grasses are a minor or infrequent component, whereas stones, boulders and bare rock are usually conspicuous.\n\n\n30\nShort-rotation Cropland\nLand regularly cultivated for the production of cereal, root, and seed crops, vegetables, strawberries and field nurseries, often including intervening grassland, fallow land, and other covers not delineated separately\n\n\n33\nOrchards, Vineyards or Other Perennial Crops\nLand managed for the production of grapes, pip, citrus and stone fruit, nuts, olives, berries, kiwifruit, and other perennial crops.\n\n\n44\nDepleted Grassland\nAreas, of mainly former short tussock grassland in the drier eastern South Island high country, degraded by over-grazing, fire, rabbits and weed invasion among which Hieracium species are conspicuous. Short tussocks usually occur, as do exotic grasses, but bare ground is more prominent.\n\n\n45\nHerbaceous Freshwater Vegetation\nHerbaceous wetland communities occurring in freshwater habitats where the water table is above or just below the substrate surface for most of the year. The class includes rush, sedge, restiad, and sphagnum communities and other wetland species, but not flax nor willows which are mapped as Flaxland and Deciduous Hardwoods respectively.\n\n\n46\nHerbaceous Saline Vegetation\nHerbaceous wetland communities occurring in saline habitats subject to tidal inundation or saltwater intrusion. Commonly includes club rush, wire rush and glasswort, but not mangrove which is mapped separately.\n\n\n47\nFlaxland\nAreas dominated by New Zealand flax usually swamp flax (harakeke) but occasionally mountain flax (wharariki) on cliffs and mountain slopes.\n\n\n50\nFernland\nBracken fern, umbrella fern, or ring fern, commonly on sites with low fertility and a history of burning. Mānuka, gorse, and/or other shrubs are often a component of these communities.\n\n\n51\nGorse and/or Broom\nScrub communities dominated by gorse or Scotch broom.\n\n\n54\nBroadleaved Indigenous Hardwoods\nLowland scrub communities dominated by indigenous mixed broadleaved shrubs such as wineberry, mahoe, five-finger, Pittosporum spp, fuchsia, tutu, titoki and tree ferns. This class is usually indicative of advanced succession toward indigenous forest.\n\n\n55\nSub Alpine Shrubland\nHighland scrub dominated by indigenous low-growing shrubs including species of Hebe, Dracophyllum, Olearia, and Cassinia. This class is also recorded where temperature inversions have created cooler micro-climates at lower elevations e.g. the ‘frost flats’ of the central North Island.\n\n\n56\nMixed exotic shrubland\nCommunities of introduced shrubs and climbers such as boxthorn, hawthorn, elderberry, blackberry, sweet briar, buddleja, and old man’s beard.\n\n\n58\nMatagouri or Grey Scrub\nScrub and shrubland comprising small-leaved, often divaricating shrubs such as matagouri, Coprosma spp., Muehlenbeckia spp., Cassinia spp., and Parsonsia spp. These, from a distance, often have a grey appearance.\n\n\n64\nForest - Harvested\nPredominantly bare ground arising from the harvesting of exotic forest or, less commonly, the clearing of indigenous forest.\n\n\n68\nDeciduous Hardwoods\nExotic deciduous woodlands, predominantly of willows or poplars but also of oak, elm, ash or other species. Commonly alongside inland water (or as part of wetlands), or as erosion-control, shelter and amenity plantings.\n\n\n70\nMangrove\nShrubs or small trees of the New Zealand mangrove (Avicennia marina subspecies australascia).\n\n\n80\nPeat Shrubland (Chatham Is)\nLow-growing shrubland communities usually dominated by Dracophyllum spp. in association with Cyathodes spp. and ground ferns. Mapped only on the Chatham Islands.\n\n\n81\nDune Shrubland (Chatham Is)\nLow-growing shrubland communities dominated by Leucopogon spp., Pimelia arenaria and Coprosma spp., in association with sedges and scattered herbs and grasses.

    "text": "8.2 Land Use\nNew Zealand currently lacks an official land use classification framework, but a proposal has been developed (Law 2024) and can be implemented during soil survey work. As shown in Figure 8.1, the proposed New Zealand Standard Land Use Classification (NZSLUC) has three nested levels with increasing specificity. The system also allows for recording further information as ‘attributes’ of the land use (e.g tenure or management practices). This classification can be applied independent of scale, so advice on how and when to apply it to Landscapes and Landforms follows.\nLand use classification does not have to be carried out in the field provided adequate supporting information (e.g. notes and photographs) are available for later use. Given that the classification is expected to evolve over time, the observation date can be used to infer the edition in use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Overview of the New Zealand Standard Land Use Classification system (reproduced from Law (2024), p. 44)\n\n\n\n\n8.2.1 Land use at Landscape scale\nThe Landscape will most likely contain multiple land uses. Record the primary land use and up to two ancillary land uses, but only to the second level of the classification. Uses recorded must be considered to occupy at least 20% of the landscape under examination.\nThis parameter is optional as it may only be useful when writing high-level reporting or metadata.\n\n\n8.2.2 Land use at Landform scale\nThe Landform is a more local concept. As such it is less likely to contain multiple land uses, and these should be recorded at the third level of the classification.

    "section": "",
    "text": "10.1 Defining the site\nSoil profiles are described at sites. The ‘site’ concept is necessarily somewhat flexible to account for the range of sampling purposes and methods. Generally speaking, it is considered to include the immediate surroundings of a profile description, up to a maximum radius of ~10 m. As such, it will generally sit within a single landform. Where a site is close to a landform edge and the processes operating on the neighbouring landform are not judged to affect the profile being described, those neighbouring landforms should be ignored.\nLarger sampling plots or long transects that cross multiple landforms (or even landscapes) should be treated as a series of related sites, rather than a single site.\nThe soil profile description starts with an observation of the site’s surface and works downwards towards the parent material. The chief tasks are assessing the surface, delineating pedologic horizons (and any additional geogenic layers, if present) and describing their morphological character.\nBefore beginning a soil profile description, it is essential to record some additional reference data.",

    "section": "10.2 Reference data",
    "text": "10.2 Reference data\nReference data is metadata that clearly identifies a soil profile description. These data enable the description to be linked with other profiles, samples, analytical results and photographs. Reference data includes:\n\nan identifier\nwho completed the description\nwhen and where it was located\nwhy the description was needed\nhow the location was chosen\nwhat equipment was used\ndepth of observation\n\nThese data are discussed in turn below.\n\n10.2.1 Site identifier\nAssign each profile description an identifier that is at least unique at a whole-of-project level, and preferably at a whole-of-organisation level. There are many ways to build identifier systems (see Note 10.1), but a good system usually has a predictable structure, is open-ended, and is easy to remember. Incorporating location data into the identifier can help avoid confusion between multiple projects within an organisation.\ne.g. a region code followed by a sequential number: WLG_001.\nThis kind of identifier is ‘semi-unique’ in that there is still some potential for confusion if the data is combined with datasets from other sources - for example, a vegetation survey group working independently in the same region may have decided to use the same naming protocol for their sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 10.1: Unique identifiers\n\n\n\n\n\nProfile identifier formats are often a compromise between robustness and simplicity. Well-designed databases use truly unique identifiers for every piece of data they hold. Under contemporary best practice, these are usually ‘UUIDs’, 128-bit hexadecimal codes (see Davis et al. (2024)). Although technically robust, these are difficult to work with day-to-day, and most workers will find themselves preferring to interact with simpler semi-unique identifiers. In a soil profile database, semi-unique identifiers should be implemented as UUID aliases. End users should primarily interact with the aliases, and the UUIDs should remain hidden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 10.2: Working in teams\n\n\n\n\n\nSemi-unique identifiers require active management when working with multiple field teams operating in parallel. This process avoids the risk of two sites being given the same ID on the same day. Each team should be assigned a ‘block’ of identifiers to work through, large enough to cover the intended number of profile descriptions. Unused numbers may need be flagged in databases (e.g. in project-level metadata) to prevent future users erroneously thinking that site data is missing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 10.3: Other profile groupings\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may be desirable to be able to group profile descriptions in more complex ways within a database. Examples of these might include\n\ndescriptions belonging to a transect or plot\ndescriptions representing a chrono-, climo- or topo-sequence\n\nA tagging system, where multiple labels can be added to a given site, can be useful in these cases. Otherwise, consider whether additional custom metadata fields should be implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.2 Description authors\nEach profile description must have a single responsible author. Record their name. Additional participants should also be noted - soil description is often a group activity. Where sample chain of custody needs to be tracked, recording the name of the sampler may also be necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution 10.1: Data privacy\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Zealand data privacy laws are strict. Personally identifying information must be stored securely and not distributed without a good reason. Personal details such as names may not be publishable without explicit consent. Data storage solutions must respect these requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.3 Site location\nRecord location coordinates as eastings and northings in New Zealand Transverse Mercator, e.g 1586090E, 5405720N.\nLocation coordinates are the minimum requirement for site location; see Chapter 3 for a more detailed discussion.\n\n\n10.2.4 Date of observation\nRecord the date of observation using the ISO 8601 standard, YYYY-MM-DD (International Organization for Standardization 2019) e.g., 2025-01-01. Time is not essential but is recommended, as it can be useful for correlating site descriptions with photographs or other data recorded using digital means (e.g. GPS tracks, environmental sensor data). If recording time, use the 24-hour format, e.g. 14:35 for 2:35 pm.\n\n\n10.2.5 Site purpose\nThe original task for which a site was observed can affect what data is recorded and is relevant to data re-use decisions.\nRecord the reason for observing the site using the schema in Table 10.1. This parameter does not need to be recorded in the field.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.1: Site purpose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nE\nMapping exploration\nReconnaissance sites, or sites described in the early stages of building knowledge to underpin, for example, a soil map. May have biased or opportunistic sample locations (e.g. chosen during fieldwork) and moderate location precision\n\n\nV\nMapping validation\nSites described when there is already a substantial knowledge base from previous work, with the purpose of gap‑filling or refining. May be low‑detail, as their main role is to confirm or disprove predictions\n\n\nR\nResearch\nSites described to support a scientific investigation, which may or may not be related to soil mapping. Often predetermined by a model and located with high precision\n\n\nM\nMonitoring\nSites intended primarily for repeated, regular re‑sampling over time. This code implies ongoing measurements, with an expectation of minimal major disturbance between visits\n\n\nT\nReference\nCalibration sites that provide a definitive description and analysis of a soil type, serving as benchmarks for consistent classification. Typically have high morphological detail and extensive analytical data, representing ‘ideal’ profiles for particular soil classes\n\n\nD\nDevelopment\nSites established to inform proposed or planned changes to the land, such as altering land use or undertaking construction. Often part of resource consent planning. The soil may be removed or sealed after observation, limiting data re‑use potential\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.6 Site selection method\nSpatial sampling strategies vary in their statistical properties. Soil data is stored for long periods and is often re-used for multiple projects; specific re-uses may not be appropriate or may require that certain permissions be obtained.\nRecord the spatial sampling strategy used using the schema in Table 10.2. This parameter does not usually need to be recorded in the field.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.2: Spatial sampling strategies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nA\nArbitrary\nSites chosen while in the field, in response to direct observation of on-ground conditions. These are often practical and time-efficient but are also likely to over-sample the more easily accessible and/or interesting parts of the landscape, to the detriment of overall representativeness\n\n\nD\nData-driven\nSites chosen before a field visit using a loose set of rules or principles (e.g. “visit the major landforms on this farm but stay close to tracks”). May be subject to minor changes once on site\n\n\nM\nModel-based\nSites chosen before a field visit using a deterministic and replicable set of rules, including rules for relocating sites where on-ground conditions make this necessary\n\n\nR\nRandom\nSites chosen by a randomised method, including stratified-random sampling\n\n\nT\nTransect\nSites chosen to form a line over the land surface, with or without regular spacing\n\n\nG\nGrid\nSites chosen to form a regular or semi-regular lattice over the land surface\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Arbitrary, D data-driven, and R model-based sampling all represent attempts to use secondary environmental data sources to increase the efficiency of fieldwork, with the goal of minimising total sites while maximising the representativeness and quality of information gathered at each site. The success of these strategies depends on whether relevant and accurate model inputs are available.\nR Random, T (regular) transect and G (regular) grid sampling effectively ignore environmental parameters, although stratified random sampling might partially incorporate such information. These strategies are useful when the spatial distribution of a parameter of interest is unknown or poorly understood, but can lead to sites in inefficient or unsafe locations.\nSome of these methods can be combined - for example, data-driven transect choices with randomised locations along each. In such cases, the ‘last choice’ should be recorded - in this example, R. The details of the full sampling strategy should be discussed in project metadata.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 10.4: How many sites?\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimating the number of sites required to complete a project and choosing an optimal sampling strategy is outside the scope of this document. Advice on these topics can be found in Grealish (2017) and McKenzie et al. (2008).\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.7 Exposure type\nThe method by which the soil was exposed for observation affects which parameters can be recorded, or at least recorded reliably. Record profile exposure method using one of the options in Table 10.3.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.3: Method of profile exposure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nP1\nStandard pit\nPit or trench &gt; 1 m wide, exposing the complete profile to regolith or bedrock\n\n\nP2\nMinimal pit\nPit up to 0.5 m wide and generally no deeper than 1m\n\n\nE\nExposure\nRoad cutting or similar, chipped back and cleaned\n\n\nC1\nLarge Core\nRelatively undisturbed soil core, ≥ 30 mm diameter\n\n\nC2\nSmall Core\nRelatively undisturbed soil core, &lt; 30 mm diameter\n\n\nA\nAuger\nHand or mechanical auger, including e.g. post hole diggers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA samples cannot be used to reliably determine soil structure due to the degree of disturbance.\nCombined sampling is common in field mapping, e.g. small pit excavation to ~50-75 cm followed by augering to a required depth in relatively well-understood landscapes. Record each method used and note the depth at which the method changed, e.g., P2/A (75 cm).\nGouge-style augers used in soft marine sediments may be included in C1 even though they may narrow to &lt; 30 mm at their maximum depth.\nC2 style samplers are common in paddock-scale monitoring and research, where they are used for rapid surface measurement. These are not generally suitable for mapping as they cannot sample below the topsoil.\n\nFurther discussion of appropriate tools for soil profile exposure may be found in Section A.1, and methods in Section C.1.\n\n\n10.2.8 Depth of observation\nRecord the maximum depth of observation from the soil surface in whole centimetres. This depth does not necessarily need to be recorded in the field as it can be determined from the lower depth of the last horizon in the profile description.\nA full profile description ideally extends to bedrock or underlying geological material, but such materials may not always be accessible with the equipment and time available. More commonly, reaching the C horizon (Section 19.1) is the deepest practically achievable goal. The minimum depth of observation for most applications in New Zealand, where possible, is 100 cm. Classification systems like the New Zealand Soil Classification (Hewitt and MWLR Pedology Staff, 2025) and LUC (Lynn et al. 2009) rely on ruling out certain soil features within that depth range, as well as positively identifying others.\n\n10.2.8.1 Stopping early\nWhen the target depth cannot be achieved, note the reason for stopping early using the codes in Table 10.4.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.4: Stoppage reason\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nB\nBedrock\nUnderlying fresh rock mass encountered, no more soil or weathering substrate to describe\n\n\nR\nResistance\nMaterials too difficult to extract with available equipment\n\n\nC\nCollapse\nExcavation unstable or unsafe due to e.g. wetness or loose particle packing\n\n\nW\nWater\nExcavation reached the water table and cannot extract saturated material from below\n\n\nI\nIdentified\nThe depth required to confirm a target parameter of interest was reached\n\n\nO\nOther\nCircumstances unrelated to the soil itself caused early stoppage",

Data is gathered at the landform scale with any site-scale deviations noted. More specific measurements are taken at the site scale when observing the land surface (Chapter 11).\n\n10.3.1 Location\nLocation coordinates are captured as reference data (Section 10.2.3). Additionally, record elevation in meters, and note the sensor or data source used to obtain location and elevation data using Table 3.1 and Table 3.2 respectively. If the equipment in use does not estimate expected error automatically, estimate it manually.\nE.g., 1586090E, 5405722N GS (462 ± 2 m A) for a location obtained using a smartphone, and an elevation measured with a calibrated altimeter.\nWhen establishing a monitoring site, record additional data relevant to relocating the site during future visits as described in Section 3.2.\n\n\n10.3.2 Geomorphology\nRecord one each of landscape, landform, and landform element, using the codes in Table 4.2, Table 4.3, and Table 4.4 respectively.

The land surface at a site is then described primarily in terms of its slope, aspect, and surface cover. If present, surface water and microrelief features should also be recorded. Ongoing or recent erosion and/or deposition events may be briefly noted or described in more detail.\nSlope is the inclination of the land surface relative to the horizontal plane. Slope steepness affects many soil processes, notably erosion, water run-off and infiltration behaviour.\nDirect measurements of slope should be taken over a minimum distance of 20 metres. Stand 10 m upslope from the point of observation and measure downhill along the steepest gradient that passes through the point of observation. Record slope in units of degrees, with a maximum precision of 0.1. Record ND if slope cannot be reliably determined. Record NR if no measurement was taken. Ignore the influence of microrelief features smaller than the site extent while measuring slope (see Section 11.7.2, e.g., steep short slopes from track cuttings).\nPrecision needs will vary with slope and survey purpose; whole number degrees are sufficient on any slope over about 5 degrees, but finer gradations can be useful for flatter locations.

(2012)) and is not consistent when it is, e.g.\n\n0.58° (~1%) for level ground in National Committee on Soil and Terrain (2024)\n2.86° (5%) in Hurst et al. (2022)\n\nThe slope measurement method in use can restrict the recordable limit of flat land. For instance, a hand-held clinometer may be difficult to use consistently and accurately at slopes of less than 3°, whereas survey-grade equipment (e.g. a tripod-mounted laser level) will have a higher accuracy.\nSlope calculated from a DEM also has inherent limitations. For example, a DEM with a cell size of 20 m and a vertical resolution of 0.5 m cannot discriminate slope increments of less than ~1.43° (\\(tan^{-1}(0.5/20)\\)).\nFor site-scale aspect measurement, a flatness threshold of 1° (1.75%) is acceptable. This equates to a ~35 cm fall over 20 m.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 11.2: Equipment for measuring slope and aspect\n\n\n\n\n\nSlope and aspect are conventionally measured with analog tools - a clinometer for slope, and a compass for aspect. Digital versions of these tools are increasingly available, usually embedded in smartphones. Smartphones can sense slope and magnetic direction using a combination of accelerometers, magnetometers, and gyroscopes, assisted by software. Reliability and accuracy varies by device make and model (Tavani et al. 2022), so any device being used for this task should be assessed first. If the device proves sufficiently reliable, it can be recorded as type C in both Table 11.1 and Table 11.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 11.3: Extracting slope and aspect from DEMs\n\n\n\n\n\nSlope data for a site can be extracted from a DEM, provided some conditions are met:\n\nCell size should be less than 10 m; larger cells systematically underestimate local slope\nDEM source should ideally be of type D for acceptable accuracy (see Table 3.2)\nExtract the median slope within a 10 m radius, not the single value directly under the recorded point\nReview and, if necessary, adjust slopes extracted from sites described on exposures. These may be overestimates (e.g. where a track cuts into a slope, the values upslope behind the site would better represent the soil-forming environment). Sites located close to landform or landscape boundaries may also need review. For example, for a site in the base of a narrow valley, the slope of the valley sides will differ from the slope of the valley floor. If the extraction window includes both the valley floor and sides, median slope will be overestimated.\n\nAspect data is subject to similar constraints, with two additional issues to consider:\n\nAspect calculated from a DEM will correspond to ‘map north’, while aspect measured directly will correspond to magnetic north. Adjustments for declination will be required.\nSoftware used to calculate aspect sometimes defaults to reporting in degrees anticlockwise from east (consistent with trigonometry rather than orienteering conventions), and can vary in whether and how it signifies flat areas.",

    "section": "11.7 Microrelief",
    "text": "11.7 Microrelief\nMicrorelief is a term covering small-scale, regular or semi-regular repeating patterns of surface deformation. Microrelief occurs within a landform, so its components are smaller than the landform itself - often too small to be reliably sensed remotely.\nConsider the following example of how microrelief fits into a particular site-setting context. In a hill country landscape, a north-facing slope landform is used for sheep grazing. Over time, stock movement has created small, step-like terraces on the slope surface. The terraces, known as terracettes, are a form of biotic microrelief, are 20-30 cm high and spaced 1-2 m apart. While the terracettes do not alter the overall form of the slope, they influence local surface water movement and erosion.\nMicrorelief presence and character can help signify particular soil types, and also influences many small-scale soil processes such as local water infiltration, accumulation of surface litter, and topsoil development.\n\n11.7.1 Natural microrelief\nNatural microrelief emerges from a similar set of drivers to soil formation itself. Record the dominant microrelief driver and form using the codes in Table 11.10 and Table 11.11. In practice the type categories can overlap and interact, but a dominant force should usually be apparent. Optionally, record the average height and spacing of repeating microrelief elements in centimetres.\nWhere the microrelief pattern is larger than the profile being examined, note the location of the profile relative to the pattern, e.g., whether a core has been drilled in a dip.\n\n\n\n\nTable 11.10: Drivers of natural microrelief (adapted from National Committee on Soil and Terrain (2024) and IUSS Working Group WRB (2022))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nN\nNone\nSite surface is naturally smooth, or level\n\n\nG\nSoil\nInduced by shrink-swell clay activity e.g. gilgai\n\n\nB\nBiotic\nInduced by plant or animal activity e.g. forest dimples from treethrow\n\n\nC\nClimatic\nInduced by temperature extremes or wind and water e.g. frost heave, sand ripples\n\n\nT\nTerrain\nInduced by mass movement effects on slopes\n\n\nS\nSubstrate\nInduced by changes to the substrate e.g. small karst features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 11.11: Natural microrelief forms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nR\nRipples\nSmall elongate rises above a planar surface\n\n\nH\nHummocks\nSmall rounded rises above a planar surface\n\n\nD\nDips\nSmall hollows set into a planar surface or slope\n\n\nU\nUndulating\nPattern of alternating small hummocks and dips\n\n\nT\nTerracettes\nSmall shelves or steps on a larger slope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.7.2 Anthropogenic microrelief\nSmall-scale human alterations to the soil surface are common in agricultural and urban areas (both current and former).

    "text": "12.1 Defining the soil surface\nA soil horizon is a distinct zone that can be identified within a soil profile, usually but not always parallel to the land surface. Soil horizons are distinguished by differences in texture, stoniness, structure, colour, consistence or other soil properties as described in the following sections. Delineated horizons should ideally represent depth intervals over which important soil attributes change minimally, although some short-range internal variation may occur. Conversely, the horizon boundaries should represent depth intervals over which there is a relatively high rate of change of important soil properties. Soil horizons emerge from a complex interaction of differentiating and homogenising forces, the detailed discussion of which is beyond the scope of this handbook. See Hartemink et al. (2020) and Palmer et al. (2025) for further reading.\nSoil horizons are commonly grouped into two major zones - the topsoil, where biological activity is elevated and new additions of soil parent material may be received, and the subsoil, a zone where weathering processes are concentrated, generating new soil minerals and accumulating materials from above. Below these zones, collectively called the ‘solum’, a ‘subsolum’ of variably weathered soil parent materials continues, often for many meters. These materials can include paleosols buried by subsequent depositional events, unconsolidated deposits that have not been subject to strong weathering, and rocks weathering in place. In New Zealand, many landscapes are underlain by sedimentary rocks that were not strongly consolidated before becoming exposed to weathering forces, so the boundary between the solum and the subsolum can be particularly difficult to define.\nWhile this handbook focuses primarily on describing the solum, the subsolum, when encountered, should be described as well. Subsolum materials play a key role in deep drainage, groundwater recharge, slope stability, and ecological support (Juilleret et al. 2016). ‘Horizon’ boundaries within the subsolum will most commonly relate to lithological or depositional discontinuities.\nThe soil surface has a slightly more restrictive definition than the land surface. The soil surface begins below the layer of fresh leaf litter or small living plants, and at the top of organic soil materials such as decomposing litter or peat. The mineral soil surface is further restricted, identified as the top of the first horizon that is dominated by mineral soil material. Horizon depths are defined with reference to the soil surface overall - thus only fresh litter and/or small plants should be scraped back before measuring.\ndraw this",

    "section": "12.2 Recording depths",
    "text": "12.2 Recording depths\nHorizon depths are recorded starting from the soil surface at 0 cm and working downwards cumulatively.\nWhen examining single small cores or auger points (see Table 10.3, type A, C1 and perhaps C2), record the observable upper and lower boundary depths of each horizon from the soil surface in whole centimetres (e.g. 28-38 cm).\nWhere a wider exposure (see Table 10.3, type E, P1, P2) or multiple undisturbed cores are available and greater detail is desired, one may choose to record upper and lower boundary depths as a median and range, again in whole centimetres (e.g. 28 cm (27-29), 38 cm (37-40)). At least 5 measurements should contribute to such an assessment. This practice may be useful for describing irregular, convolute or discontinuous horizons (Section 12.3).\nMeasure boundaries to and from the midpoint of each horizon transition zone (see Section 12.4). Where depths are correctly measured, horizon thicknesses can be calculated after fieldwork.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant 12.1: Defining horizons on steep slopes\n\n\n\n\n\nOn steeper slopes, measuring horizons from vertical exposures can exaggerate horizon thicknesses, as the soil horizons mantle the landscape perpendicular to the sloping surface (Prietzel and Wiesmeier 2019). This starts to matter at slopes &gt; 25°, and progressively becomes more important - especially when calculating volumetric stocks of soil components. Figure 12.1 shows how a vertical 30-cm depth represents a progressively shallower ‘true depth’ as slope increases.\nWhere depths are measured perpendicular to the surface, no adjustment needs to be made. To adjust vertically measured horizon depths to correct for slope, apply the formula \\(depth × cos(slope)\\). Supply depth in cm and slope in radians. Slopes measured in degrees can be converted to radians using the formula \\((slope × \\pi) ÷ 180\\). If this correction is made, record that it has been done in the site notes to prevent the horizon depths from being adjusted any further.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1: Depth exaggeration by slope.",

Record the dominant mode of origin for the structural units observed in each horizon using the options in Table 13.1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.1: Type of structural development (adapted from Anderson et al. (2024))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nP\nPedogenic\nStructural units meet the definition of natural soil peds and occur largely within the solum\n\n\nG\nGeogenic\nStructural units are inherited from parent materials that have undergone limited weathering e.g. bedding planes, and occur largely below the solum\n\n\nA\nAnthropogenic\nStructural units have been induced by human activity, usually within the solum and most commonly in surface horizons\n\n\nU\nUnknown\nType of structural development could not be determined with confidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.1.2 Structure development\nDegree of structural development (also frequently referred to as, ‘grade’, ‘pedality’ or ‘aggregation’) refers to how distinctive ped appearance is and how much of the soil within a horizon is organised into peds. Developed ped structure can suggest information about mineralogy, biological activity, and soil age. Structural development also provides information about permeability, in concert with texture and firmness.\nFor rapid assessment, record degree of overall structural development once per horizon using Table 13.2. For routine or detailed assessment, record degree of development for each type of structural unit observed (if more than one is seen; see also Section 13.1.4.2).\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.2: Degree of structural development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nApedal\nG\nSingle grain\nMaterial is structureless or has &lt;15% identifiable structural units, is uncemented and falls apart into single grains when disturbed\n\n\nV\nMassive\nMaterial is structureless or has &lt;15% identifiable structural units, is uncemented and holds together until substantially disturbed, and has no fissures spaced closer than 200 mm\n\n\nPedal\nW\nWeak\nMaterial where 15–25% of the material comprises coherent structural units\n\n\nM\nModerate\nMaterial where 25–75% of the material comprises coherent structural units\n\n\nS\nStrong\nMaterial where &gt;75% of the material comprises coherent structural units\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.1.3 Structure shape\nStructural units take on a range of distinctive shapes depending on their mineralogy, profile position, organic matter content, and the hydrological and climatic regime. Briefly, four major classes can be recognised, each with a few subtypes:\n\nBlocky: Blocky peds are roughly cubic (having six faces) and pack relatively closely together, but still have defined interped spaces. Blocky peds are most common in the upper subsoil but can be found in any part of the solum.\n\nAngular blocky: Angular blocky peds have sharp corners and flat faces, so can pack closely together.\nSubangular blocky: Subangular blocky peds have slightly rounded corners and more irregular faces, while still being recognisably rectangular.\n\nRounded: Rounded peds have more than six faces and sometimes pack relatively loosely, creating a large proportion of irregular macrovoid space. Rounded peds are most commonly observed in surface horizons.\n\nPolyhedral: Polyhedral peds have a rounded shape with more than six faces and angular edges. Their surfaces are irregular, with small divots that align with protrusions in neighbouring peds. As such, they fit together relatively closely, a characteristic sometimes described as ‘accommodation to surrounding peds’. Polyhedral peds can be observed throughout the solum.\nGranular: Granular peds are rounded but lack sharp edges or the divots that allow close packing, and can be very porous. They are most common in near-surface horizons with high organic matter, and can sometimes be held in a net of fine roots.\nCast: Cast peds are created by soil fauna, comprising a mix of excreted soil and biological material like mucous or saliva. They are smooth and rounded or ovate and can be observed scattered through surface horizons or down channels extending into subsoil layers. Most are made by earthworms, but beetles and other insects can also create casts.\n\nPlatelike: Platelike peds are wider than they are tall and develop roughly horizontally or in parallel to the soil surface. Layers of platelike structures overlap each other, creating a convoluted path for water or roots moving downwards.\n\nPlaty: Platy structures are flat-faced and sharp-edged, like angular blocky structures, but are usually very thin. Platy structures can be pedogenic, emerging from freeze-thaw processes, geogenic, reflecting the structure left by rock weathering in place, or anthropogenic, reflecting compaction from heavy machinery use.\nLenticular: Lenticular structures have thicker middles and curved surfaces that come to a point along their outer edge. Lenticular structures emerge from shrink-swell clay activity and often have striated faces (Section 16.4).\nWedgelike: Wedge structures are related to lenticular structures and appear like a lenticular shape that has been cut in half vertically through its thickest part.\n\nPrismlike: Prismlike peds are taller than they are wide and have relatively flat faces that fit together closely. They are confined to subsoils and would only be observable near the surface if erosion has recently removed the topsoil.\n\nPrismatic: Prismatic peds have a flat top surface with sharp edges.\nColumnar: Columnar peds have a rounded, or domed, top surface, creating an irregular horizon boundary with the overlying material.\n\n\nWhere distinct structural units can be identified in a horizon (development types W, M, S), record their dominant shape using Table 13.3.\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.3: Structural shapes (adapted from Milne et al. (1995), IUSS Working Group WRB (2022), and National Committee on Soil and Terrain (2024))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDiagram\n\n\n\n\nBlocky\nAB\nAngular blocky\nto be added\n\n\nSB\nSubangular blocky\nto be added\n\n\nRounded\nPH\nPolyhedral\nto be added\n\n\nGR\nGranular\nto be added\n\n\nCA\nCast\nto be added\n\n\nPlatelike\nPL\nPlaty\nto be added\n\n\nLE\nLenticular\nto be added\n\n\nWE\nWedgelike\nto be added\n\n\nPrismlike\nPR\nPrismatic\nto be added\n\n\nCO\nColumnar\nto be added\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 13.1: Older terms for structural units\n\n\n\n\n\nSome structural terms that don’t seem to fit into Table 13.3 can be found in older soils literature. These terms should no longer be used because they conflate size and shape in a way that modern schemas seek to avoid.\n\nCrumb: a very fine structure seen in many silty to loamy horizons. The appearance is as of breadcrumbs, with 0.5–2 mm rounded peds loosely to firmly packed, depending on depth and drainage. Larger weak subangular blocky structures in well-drained allophanic soils almost always break down into moderately or strongly developed crumb structure. Crumb should be described as type P with GR shape.\nNut: a larger version of crumb, usually 5–20 mm in diameter, often encased in a network of grass roots. Nut structures are more common in topsoils but can also occur in well-drained loamy subsoils. Nut should be described as type P with GR or PR shape.\nClod: a tillage-induced structure &gt; 100 mm in length. Clods should be described as type A structures with SB or PH shape.\nFragment: a tillage-induced structure &lt; 100 mm in length. Fragments should be described as type A structures with SB or PH shape.\n\nPed strength (Section 17.3.2) can assist in identifying tillage-induced structures, as they can be compacted and firmer than pedogenic structural units.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.1.4 Structure size\nRecord the median length of the structural units observed, along their shortest axis. Record in millimetres with a range estimate, e.g. 25 ± 2 mm. Options for classifying the recorded measurements may be found in Section E.2.1.1.\nFor rapid assessment, rather than recording a numeric value, the dominant size may be noted as C for Coarse when over 20 mm in size, and F for Fine when &lt;20 mm.\n\n13.1.4.1 Associated structures\nMany horizons only have one major structure, but multiple structural units may also coexist. For instance, casts may be interspersed among polyhedral, granular or blocky peds in a surface horizon, or a saprolith layer (Section 12.8.2) might have remnant geogenic bedding among more heavily weathered, apedal-massive material. In such cases, record the structures separately. Where the horizon is partly apedal, estimate the volume of apedal material.\nExample: G M PL 20 ± 3 with V 35%\n\n\n13.1.4.2 Nested structures\nWell-developed peds may be nested, with large structures breaking down to smaller ones that may also be a different type and shape. For highly detailed descriptions, multiple sets of nesting peds may be described in terms of their origin, development, shape and size.\nFor example, P S PR 80 ± 10 breaking to P M AB 20 ± 2.\n\n\n\n13.1.5 Method: Assessing structure in the field\n\nTo assess the structure in an E or P2 type profile (Table 10.3), insert a spade horizontally near the base of the horizon and push down on the handle, levering out a section of soil. Drop the spade blade with the soil, approximately 0.3 m onto a hard surface, e.g., the blade of another spade. Remove major roots that bind the mass together and again note the attributes of the newly produced solids. Note that this procedure will not necessarily disaggregate very moist or wet soils.\nStructure may also be observed in situ by using a small hand tool to gently pick back the profile face. See Section C.1. Structure of hard layers may need to be assessed in place, or by careful removal of individual units, and will usually require an E or P2 type profile.\nFor smaller exposures (P1, C1, C2), remove a handful of soil from the extracted horizon and carefully use your fingers to disaggregate the soil mass to segregate all peds. Do not destroy peds to create fragments, or disaggregate existing apedal material. When coring, also use a spade to extract a block of adjacent surface material so that at least the topmost horizon can be assessed in detail.\nAssessing structure is generally impossible for A augered profiles, as the extraction method destroys it. The surface horizon should still be extracted with a spade and assessed if possible.\n\nDirect measurement of peds will help estimate size. Weighing, or filling volumetric containers, may help estimate abundance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 13.2: Structure in organic horizons\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganic soil materials cannot be described in terms of the structural parameters in this section. Their architecture is flexible and determined largely by water content, species of origin and degree of decomposition, and are effectively all apedal-massive. The physical nature of organic soil materials is otherwise largely inferred from their textural characteristics (Section 15.1.3). However, drained peats and peaty mineral soils may have some recognisable structural development.",

    "section": "13.2 Fragments",
    "text": "13.2 Fragments\nFragments are mineral or non‑mineral components &gt;2 mm within a soil horizon. They provide information about soil development, particularly mode of emplacement (Section 12.8.3). They also reduce the soil’s water‑holding capacity and, when large and abundant enough, can restrict land use and management practices.\nFor very rapid assessment, estimate total fragment abundance (rocks and non-rock materials as well as any artefacts) as an integer percentage of the whole horizon volume. Where fragments are absent, always record 0% as confirmation.\n\n13.2.1 Rock fragments\nRock fragments are soil mineral particles &gt;2 mm. For rapid assessment, use the texture class code modifiers provided for rock fragments in Section 15.1.2, and confirm absence by recording an abundance of 0%.\nExample: SL(G) for a sandy loam soil with 5–35% gravels (size range 2–20 mm).\nFor routine assessment, append an estimate of rock fragment abundance as integer percentage of the whole horizon volume, as well as dominant lithology class using Table 5.1 and shape using Table 13.4, Table 13.5 and Table 13.6.\nExample: SL(G) 15% Hs CRS for a sandy loam soil with 15% compact, rounded, smooth greywacke gravels.\nFor detailed assessment, one may optionally continue to add detail by recording volumetric abundance, lithology, shape and weathering status for each of the three rock fragment size classes given in Table 15.5. The three additional gravel size subdivisions in Table 15.7 may also be used. Picking and sieving from a known volume of soil will likely be required for sufficient accuracy when making detailed assessments.\n\n13.2.1.1 Rock fragment shape\nRock fragment shape is partly determined by parent rock lithology and stratigraphy, and otherwise by the effects of chemical and particularly physical weathering. Abrasion during transport, freeze/thaw processes, and relief of overburden pressure can contribute to rounding-off of corners and can smooth or roughen outer surfaces. Fragment shape affects how individual particles move and at a broader scale, affects processes like slope stability. Rock fragment shape is a function of form, roundedness, and roughness.\nThe ratios between the three side lengths of the smallest box that can contain a rock fragment are used to classify its form. Various indices can be built from these three measurements (Blott and Pye 2008; Angelidakis et al. 2022), but overall they coalesce into four major classes as shown in Figure 13.1 and Table 13.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.1: Rock fragment form classification, adapted from @angelidakis2022. With a, b, c representing the long, intermediate, and short dimensions of a box containing a rock fragment, ratios c/b and b/a together define the range of possible shapes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.4: Rock fragment form classes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\nRatio\n\n\n\n\nC\nCompact\nRock fragments where all dimensions are similar to each other.\nb/a and c/b &gt;~2/3\n\n\nE\nElongated\nRock fragments where the two shorter dimensions are similar, and notably smaller than the longest dimension\nb/a &lt;2/3, c/b usually &gt;2/3\n\n\nB\nBladed\nRock fragments where all dimensions differ from each other\nb/a and c/b &lt;~2/3\n\n\nF\nFlat\nRock fragments where the two longer dimensions are similar, and notably larger than the shortest dimension\nb/a usually &gt;2/3, c/b &lt;2/3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoundedness refers specifically to how sharp any corners or edges present on the form might be. Precise measurement is not possible in the field, but the proportion of flat faces and visible edges and corners can be used to make a quick assessment, along with the ease of rolling the fragment in the hand or along a surface.\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.5: Rock fragment roundedness classes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nA\nAngular\nRock fragments with clear, well-defined corners separated by flat outer faces.\n\n\nS\nSub-angular\nRock fragments with visible but blunt corners and edges. Outer faces my be flat, concave or convex.\n\n\nU\nSub-rounded\nRock fragments with poorly defined but appreciable corners and edges. Faces will be discernible but usually not flat.\n\n\nR\nRounded\nRock fragments with no discernible flat faces, edges or corners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, roughness represents how many smaller-scale deviations are present on the outer surfaces, and their size relative to the overall fragment. Again, precise quantification is not a field task, but can be quickly assessed with reference to visual appearance and hand-feel.\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.6: Rock fragment roughness classes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nS\nSmooth\nSurfaces are smooth to touch and appear solid and continuous.\n\n\nR\nRough\nSurfaces appear smooth but feel rough or abrasive. Small, shallow pits may intrude into the surface, embedded crystals or grains may protrude slightly.\n\n\nB\nBumpy\nSurfaces have visible divots and/or protrusions that make the fragment appear uneven from a short distance.\n\n\nI\nIrregular\nSurfaces have pronounced divots, protrusions, or large holes that make it difficult to assess overall form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.2.1.2 Rock fragment weathering\nWeathering status of rock fragments provides some information on profile age and stability, and is used in the NZSC. Weathering status may need to be assessed in relation to fresh rock from nearby exposures, where available. The weathering schema in Table 13.7 may also be applied to substrate rock masses when determining the weathering status of the horizon as a whole (Section 12.8.2).\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.7: Rock fragment weathering status (adapted from New Zealand Geotechnical Society (2005))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1\nFresh\nRock fragments show no discolouration, loss of strength, or any other effects due to chemical weathering. Fragments may still be rounded from transport\n\n\n2\nSlightly weathered\nRock fragments are not significantly weaker than when unweathered, but may be discoloured along defects, some of which may have been opened slightly\n\n\n3\nModerately weathered\nRock fragments are significantly weaker than fresh rock of similar lithology and may be broken by hammer or spade. Fragments may be discoloured both along defects and on surfaces. Discolouration will penetrate slightly into the rock material.\n\n\n4\nHighly weathered\nMost of the original rock fragment's strength is lost and the fragment may be broken by hand. Decomposition adjacent to defects and at the surface of clasts penetrates deeply into the rock material.\n\n\n5\nCompletely weathered\nOriginal rock strength is lost and the rock mass changed to a soil. Former presence of rock is only evident from 'ghost rock' structures preserved in the soil matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.2.2 Natural fragments\nBiologically-derived coarse materials can alter the soil’s water holding capacity and other parameters just as rock fragments can, although in general they can themselves hold more water. They will also break down faster.\nWhere present in significant amounts (&gt; 5% by volume), record each type present and estimate volume and median fragment size in centimetres.\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.8: Non-rock fragment types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSh\nShell\nSeashells or chitinous material\n\n\nBo\nBone\nSkeletal fragments\n\n\nTi\nTimber\nDead wood from trees and shrubs, coarse roots\n\n\nCh\nCharcoal\nBurnt organic materials\n\n\nGu\nGum\nSolidified plant exudates (e.g. Kauri gum)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.2.3 Artefacts\nArtefacts can both function like rock fragments and signify strong human influence on the soil profile.\nWhere present in significant amounts, for rapid assessment simply record total volumetric percentage of artefacts per horizon. Confirm absence as 0%. For routine assessment, record each type present using Table 13.9 and estimate percentage volume and median fragment size in centimetres.\nExample: Ra 5% 6-10 cm for a horizon containing some chert flake tools.\nFor detailed assessment, for each fragment type, append any or all of the origin (Table 13.10), fixation (Table 13.11), shape (Table 13.12), and degradation (Table 13.13) codes supplied below. Colour may also be described using common terms. Additional free-text notes and photos may also be useful.\nExample: Pl 10% 2-3 cm A SF F D for a horizon containing some broken down remnants of horticultural film.\nArtefact fragments smaller than 2 mm and non-solid soil contaminants are beyond the scope of this handbook.\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.9: Artefact types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAs\nAsphalt\nAsphalt and other bitumen-containing materials\n\n\nBa\nBone - altered\nHuman-altered bone fragments\n\n\nBr\nBrick\nFired clay building materials, usually unglazed\n\n\nCr\nCeramic\nFired clay objects, usually glazed\n\n\nCe\nConcrete\nConcrete materials, cements\n\n\nGl\nGlass\nFragments from windows, containers, etc\n\n\nPl\nPlastics\nArtificial polymers (non-textile)\n\n\nRa\nRock - altered\nHuman-altered rock fragments\n\n\nSa\nShell - altered\nHuman-altered shells\n\n\nTa\nTimber - altered\nHuman-altered timber\n\n\nTn\nTextiles - natural\nFabrics and carpets made from e.g. wool\n\n\nTx\nTextiles - artificial\nFabrics and carpets derived from or dominated by plastics\n\n\nMt\nMetals\nRefined ore products\n\n\nMs\nMine Spoil\nMaterials leftover from ore processing activities, excluding overburden\n\n\nWs\nWastes\nOther domestic or commercial rubbish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.10: Artefact origin (adapted from Weber (2022))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nN\nNot verifiable\nDesignation not possible / uncertain\n\n\nC\nConsumer\nConsumer-products (everyday-products) like tools, decorative items, etc\n\n\nA\nAgricultural\nAgricultural products like straw bale nets, wire etc\n\n\nI\nIndustrial\nIndustrial products like broken pieces of industrial equipment, industrial waste\n\n\nB\nConstruction\nAll materials which were placed in soil for construction and supply purposes (e.g., pipes, power cables, geomembranes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.11: Fragment fixation (adapted from Weber (2022))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nNF\nNone\nArtefacts are not included in soil aggregates, or soil is apedal\n\n\nSF\nSolely\nSome artefacts are incorporated into soil aggregates, but most are loose\n\n\nMF\nModerate\nThe majority of artefacts are incorporated into soil aggregates, but some pieces are loose\n\n\nCF\nComplete\nAll artefacts are incorporated into soil aggregates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.12: Artefact shape (adapted from Weber (2022))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nP\nPreserved\nThe original manufactured shape of the object is recognisable\n\n\nB\nBroken\nThe fragment is recognisable as having been part of a larger object\n\n\nF\nFlat\nTabular or sheet-like\n\n\nA\nAngular\nSharp-edged\n\n\nR\nRounded\nHas edges that are not sharp\n\n\nS\nSpherical\nBall shaped or ovoid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.13: Artefact degradation (adapted from Weber (2022))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nN\nNot verifiable\nDesignation not possible / uncertain\n\n\nF\nFresh\nFresh artefacts with bright colours, unaffected shape, without signs of deterioration (cracks, broken edges, rough surfaces)\n\n\nI\nIncipient alteration\nArtefacts with incipient deterioration surface such as first cracks, broken edges or roughened/grooved surfaces\n\n\nD\nDegraded\nArtefacts with clear indications of ageing such as pale colours or obvious discolouration, strong fragmentation, frayed edges\n\n\nS\nStrongly degraded\nArtefacts with strongly degraded surfaces, faded colours, soft surface, frayed areas or edges",

    "text": "13.3 Roots\nPlant roots affect water infiltration, bind and rework the soil as they grow, and exert strong local control over soil chemistry. Their position in the soil profile can provide information about ped development, particle packing, and the presence of pans. Accurate measurement of root volumes in situ is technically challenging (Mancuso 2012; Freschet et al. 2021), requiring extensive sampling to account for spatial, temporal and interspecies variability. Such sampling may be necessary for accurate assessment of total soil composition. The majority of the root mass, particularly fine roots of herbaceous species and grasses, will be found in the topsoil. For soil classification, presence of roots and their relative position within the soil are key characteristics.\nNote that this section applies to the live root mass only.\n\n13.3.1 Root abundance\nEstimation of root volume from cross-sectional analyses is not accurate, and so the following method, reproduced from International Organization for Standardization (2019) must be considered at best a relative assessment of root abundance.\nAbundance is communicated as a count per square decimetre (100 cm2), undertaken on a pit or exposure face. For very thin horizons, a 50 cm horizontal linear transect at the horizon midpoint may be used instead. Multiple split-open cores may also be examined provided the minimum 100 cm2 area can be examined.\nFor rapid assessment, report the total number of roots. For routine assessment, report counts separately for the size classes in Table 13.14. Always confirm absence of roots by recording a 0.\nE.g. V 30, F 5, M 5, C 0 for a mixture of very fine, fine and medium roots.\nWith adequate size data, count per area can be converted to an areal percentage, e.g. 10 roots with diameter 5 mm in a 10 x 10 cm space gives a total area of \\(\\pi × 0.25^{2} × 10 = {2\\ cm^{2}}\\), or 2%.\nThe count data may be classified using Table E.7.\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.14: Plant root size classes (adapted from International Organization for Standardization (2019))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nSize range (mm)\n\n\n\n\nV\nVery Fine\n&lt;0.5\n\n\nF\nFine\n≥0.5–&lt;2.0\n\n\nM\nMedium\n≥2.0–&lt;5.0\n\n\nC\nCoarse\n≥5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.3.2 Root position\nWhere roots are present in a horizon, record how the roots are spatially distributed using the codes in Table 13.15. For rapid assessment, record the dominant position of all roots. For routine assessment, split by size. Root position cannot be reliably observed in augered samples, or in cores where structural units are known to be larger than the core diameter.\nE.g. F B, C T for a soil where fine roots are confined to voids but coarse roots are not.\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.15: Plant root position\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nW\nWithin\nRoots are primarily located within peds\n\n\nB\nBetween\nRoots are primarily located between peds, within fissures or along bedding planes\n\n\nT\nThroughout\nRoots are evenly distributed within and between peds\n\n\nU\nUnknown\nSampling method did not allow reliable observation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.3.3 Other parameters\nInformation about particular plant species contributing to the root mass and spatial organisation beyond the positional classes above (e.g. presence of mats) may prove useful in certain contexts.

    "text": "13.4 Voids and pores\nVoids and pores are an integral part of soil structure, forming the spaces that occur between and within the aggregates described in Section 13.1. They may contain air, water, or both, and play a key role in aeration, drainage, and root penetration. They are also habitat for soil meso- and microfauna. Horizon voids exclude open surface cracks, which are noted in Section 11.6, and fine pores, which are described in Section 13.4.2. Infill features, where voids have previously been created but are no longer empty of solid material, are described in Section 12.5. Voids and pores range in size from many centimetres down to nano-scale gaps in clay minerals. Only the larger end of the scale can be reasonably assessed in the field. As with measurement of roots, void space is most accurately determined in the laboratory.\n\n13.4.1 Voids\nVoids comprise pores &gt;2 mm wide. Dimensions of large, isolated voids like burrows can be measured directly and volume calculated. Areal percentage of smaller inter-ped spaces can be assessed across a cut face using the abundance charts in Section E.2.2.3 or by counting void openings. Use a minimum area of 100 cm2 for this assessment.\nFor rapid assessment, estimate the areal percentage of the horizon volume occupied by void space. Always confirm absence of voids by recording a 0.\nFor detailed assessment, identify void types using Table 13.16 and estimate the percentage of each type seen. Optionally, add connectivity using Table 13.17. Note that void connectivity may vary with soil water status.\nExample: 10% IT C for the void space in a strongly pedal, polyhedral topsoil.\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.16: Type of soil void\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nBP\nBedding plane\nA parting or discontinuity due to stratification during deposition of sedimentary particles.\n\n\nCH\nChannel\nTubular void of biological origin that is less than 20 mm in diameter (e.g. insect burrow)\n\n\nTU\nTunnel\nTubular void of biological origin that is 20 mm or more in diameter (e.g. rabbit burrow)\n\n\nFS\nFissure\nPlanar void with a width much smaller than length and depth.

Macropores are ≥0.75 mm, and micropores are &lt;0.75 mm. This division is based on the diameter above which pores are regarded as generated by soil fauna. Pores can be observed on freshly broken ped faces or broken faces of a block cut from an apedal massive horizon, but will not be observable in loose, apedal single-grain materials. Cut surfaces in moist or wet soils may smear, obscuring pore openings.\nFor routine assessment, note presence or absence of any pores visible without magnification. Ideally, make observations from at least 2-5 small samples from within a horizon.\nFor detailed assessment, count the number of macropores and micropores separately over a minimum area of 100 cm2. This may necessitate sampling several peds or small blocks from the target horizon. Counting micropores will require the use of a magnifier.\nsize example diagram here",

    "text": "13.5 Substrate-specific features\nHorizons that have experienced limited weathering may exhibit geogenic features that relate to their parent material and its mode of emplacement. These can affect water movement, slope stability and plant growth (Wysocki et al. 2005; Juilleret et al. 2016).\n\n13.5.1 Bedding\nTransported soil parent materials may comprise multiple thin layers of alternating texture or lithology. These layers can be unconsolidated (e.g. lamina or cross-bedding in aeolian and fluvial sediments), partly or fully consolidated, and may subsequently have been compressed, folded and/or faulted. Where layers of subsolum material have been identified (Section 12.8.2) and bedding is apparent within a layer, measure the median angle of the bedding off horizontal and note the degree of consolidation. For unconsolidated sediments, record the texture groups involved using Table 15.2. If the bedding is consolidated, record the dominant lithologies (Section 5.2) involved. Optionally, add a thickness range for the bedding in centimetres.\nE.g. 25°, Sm/Ss, 10-30 cm for thin, very firm marine sediments, or 2°, C/S, 0.1-0.5 cm for clay-sand lamina.\n\n\n13.5.2 Fractures\nRock at the base of the profile may be significantly fractured by tectonic and weathering processes. Where lithic or paralithic layers (Section 12.8.2) have been identified and fractures are apparent, note fracture type using Table 13.18, modal angle off horizontal in degrees, and median spacing in centimetres. For single fractures, record spacing as 0 cm.\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.18: Fracture types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nF\nFault\nTectonically induced fractures that may cut across bedding.

    "text": "14.2 Matrix colour\nThe matrix colour of the soil is the dominant ‘background’ colour. This excludes the colours of redox-induced mottles.\n\n14.2.1 Method: Determining matrix colour\n\nTake a 2-3 cm3 sample of fresh soil from the target horizon, avoiding colour transition zones (e.g. horizon boundaries). If large enough peds are available, extract a ped and break it open to expose a fresh face. Otherwise, cut or scoop a fresh sample from the soil mass.\nMoisten the sample lightly before assessing the colour, by holding the sample up against the chips in the colour book. Hold the sample just in front of a colour chip for comparison. Look for a colour where the sample appears to fade into the chip.\n\nDo not record the colour of a texture bolus or a smeared surface, as these can be altered by mixing in mottles or destroying ped surface features.\nFor sands, which may have differently-coloured grains from multiple parent materials, colour matching can be difficult. Try to pick the colour of the dominant mineral component. Holding the sample out at arms’ length may also help determine a dominant colour.\n\n\nAdditional colour information can be stored as free-text notes.\n\n\n14.2.2 Recording matrix colour\nFor routine assessment, record the single dominant matrix colour per horizon. For detailed assessment, up to three matrix colours may be recorded if necessary. It is assumed that multiple matrix colours are co-dominant, otherwise the subdominant ones must logically be recorded as colour patterns (Section 14.3).\nDry soil matrix colours are sometimes necessary as well, e.g. for diagnosing a bleached E horizon. If moist and dry matrix colours are both obtained for a horizon, append them with their moisture status as D or M.\nExample: 10YR52 M / 10YR71 D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 14.2: Low-chroma colours\n\n\n\n\n\nNaming soil horizons and classifying soils according to the NZSC requires, in many cases, the ability to identify ‘low chroma colours’. These colours have:\n\na moist chroma of ≤ 2, or\na moist chroma of 3 and a value ≥ 6.\n\nVisually, the red outline in Figure 14.1 contains the low chroma colours. These are in the same location on any given page in the Munsell colour book. Additionally, all of the colours on the Gley and White pages qualify as low chroma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.1: One page from the Munsell Soil Colour Chart book, with the low-chroma colours outlined in red.",

    "text": "15.1 Describing texture components\nA great deal of soil physical and chemical behaviour is dependant on the particle size distribution within the solid fraction - the relative dominance of particular sizes, as well as the total size range present. This includes both mineral and organic matter. In the field, particle size distribution is estimated on a per-horizon basis using a combination of visual examination and hand manipulation under moist conditions.\nThe true particle size distribution is continuous, and open-ended. For ease of communication, particle size distribution is divided into set ranges, the broadest of which are the fine earth (&lt; 2 mm) and coarse mineral (≥ 2 mm, ‘rock fragments’) fractions. Within the fine-earth fraction, three fractions are defined - sand (&lt;2.0–≥0.06 mm), silt (&lt;0.06–≥0.002 mm) and clay (&lt;0.002 mm). Organic matter is treated slightly differently, in that it can’t be separated easily from the soil mass in the field, and its particle size is less important than other characteristics (see Section 15.1.3). Field estimates of particle size distribution are commonly referred to as ‘soil texture’.",

    "text": "15.1.1 Fine earth materials\nThe composition of the fine earth mineral fraction is assessed separately to that of larger rock fragments for practical reasons - not least because rock fragments are not always present. The fine fraction is assessed in the field by removing any rock fragments present by picking or sieving, and then manipulating the remaining sample in a moist state (see Section 12.6).\nSoil texture is organised in two levels. At the broadest level, there are four major texture groups (clayey, silty, sandy, loamy), defined in Table 15.2. Within these groups, there are eleven recognised texture classes, which are the categories most commonly used in description and interpretation. The texture classes are most easily visualised on a ternary diagram, as seen in Figure 15.1. The range limits for each class are given in Table 15.3.\nThese divisions can reflect significant changes in measurable properties like hydraulic conductivity, but it is important to note that there are no sudden and obvious changes in hand-feel or visual appearance at each boundary.\n\n\n\n\nTable 15.2: Major divisions of the fine earth mineral fraction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nC\nClayey\nComprised largely of mineral particles &lt; 0.002 mm\n\n\nZ\nSilty\nComprised largely of mineral particles ≥ 0.002–&lt; .06 mm\n\n\nS\nSandy\nComprised largely of mineral particles ≥ 0.06–&lt; 2.0 mm\n\n\nL\nLoamy\nComprising a mixture of mineral particles &lt; 2.0 mm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.1: New Zealand Soil Texture Triangle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 15.3: New Zealand Texture Triangle class names and compositional limits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nClay range\nSilt range\nSand range\n\n\n\n\nSandy\nSS\nSand\n&lt; 8%\n&lt; 20%\n≥ 80%\n\n\nLS\nLoamy Sand\n&lt; 8%\n≥ 12–&lt; 40%\n≥ 52–&lt; 80%\n\n\nLoamy\nSL\nSandy Loam\n≥ 8–&lt; 18%\n&lt; 40%\n≥ 42–&lt; 92%\n\n\nSC\nSandy Clay Loam\n≥ 18–&lt; 35%\n&lt;15%\n≥ 50–&lt; 82%\n\n\nCL\nClay Loam\n≥ 18–&lt; 35%\n≥ 15–&lt; 40%\n≥ 25–&lt; 67%\n\n\nSilty\nLZ\nLoamy Silt\n&lt; 18%\n≥ 40–&lt; 82%\n&lt; 60%\n\n\nZZ\nSilt\n&lt; 18%\n≥ 82%\n&lt; 18%\n\n\nZL\nSilt Loam\n≥ 18–&lt; 35%\n≥ 40–&lt; 82%\n&lt; 42%\n\n\nClayey\nLC\nLoamy Clay\n≥ 35–&lt; 60%\n&lt; 30%\n≥ 10–&lt; 65%\n\n\nZC\nSilty Clay\n≥ 35–&lt; 60%\n≥ 30–&lt; 65 %\n&lt; 35%\n\n\nCC\nClay\n≥ 60%\n&lt; 40%\n&lt; 40%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 15.3: Soil texture triangles\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil texture triangles are a communication tool. They vary by jurisdiction, with class numbers, names, and boundary lines reflecting the local evolution of pedological practice. The triangle in use in New Zealand was formulated in the 1980’s by New Zealand pedologists to align with both the USDA texture triangle (Schoeneberger et al. 2012) and a previous New Zealand standard (Taylor and Pohlen 1979), while remaining conceptually simple and easy to amalgamate into the four texture groups (Milne et al. 1995).\nTranslating texture classes between different triangles is not recommended, although numeric data describing sand, silt and clay can be reclassified (Minasny and McBratney 2001). The class boundaries and the size fraction boundaries must both be accounted for (see Note 15.2).\n\n\n\n\n15.1.1.1 Sand fraction modifiers\nThe loamy and sandy texture classes in Table 15.3 can optionally be accompanied by additional information about the sand fraction. These codes, listed in Table 15.4, can be appended to a texture class as a prefix, e.g. KLS for coarse loamy sand. Only use a modifier when confident that ≥ 50% of the sand fraction will fall into the modifier’s size range.\n\n\n\n\nTable 15.4: Sand fraction modifiers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nF\nFine\nSand is dominantly ≥ 0.06–&lt; 0.2 mm\n\n\nM\nMedium\nSand is dominantly ≥ 0.2–&lt; 0.6 mm\n\n\nK\nCoarse\nSand is dominantly ≥ 0.6–&lt; 2.0 mm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubdivisions in the silt fraction can be determined in the laboratory but cannot be reliably detected by hand, and so are not included here.\n\n\n\n15.1.2 Rock fragments\nWhere total rock fragments occupy more than 5% of the horizon volume, their presence should be signified in the texture code. Choose the code from Table 15.5 that describes the majority of the fragments, and apply it using the conventions in Table 15.6.\n\n\n\n\nTable 15.5: Rock fragment size fractions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nG\nGravelly\nMineral particles ≥ 2–&lt; 60 mm\n\n\nC\nCobbly\nMineral particles ≥ 60–&lt; 200 mm\n\n\nB\nBouldery\nMineral particles ≥ 200 mm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 15.6: Rock fragment code rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent\nConvention\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt; 5%\nDo not append\nCL\nclay loam with ~2% gravel\n\n\n≥ 5–&lt; 35%\nAppend as suffix\nCL(G)\nclay loam with ~10% gravel\n\n\n≥ 35–&lt; 70\nAppend as prefix\n(G)CL\nclay loam with ~50% gravel\n\n\n≥ 70%\nUse as primary code\nG\nclean gravel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no upper size limit for the ‘Bouldery’ class, but in practice rocks larger than the profile are either recorded as (effectively) the bedrock (see Section 10.2.8.1, Section 19.1) or as surface features (see Section 11.3) depending on their position.\nIf a horizon has &gt; 70% rock fragments and &gt; 5% fine earth, mineral texture codes can still be appended as a suffix, e.g. G(ZL) for a gravel with some interstitial silt loam.\nWhen recording texture for a mixed fine-earth/organic horizon containing rock fragments, record the rock fragment modifier before the organic modifier, separated by a comma, e.g. SL(G, H) for a sandy loam with gravel and humus, or (G, H)SL for a gravelly, humic sandy loam.\nFor poorly sorted horizons where a single fraction does not dominate the particle size distribution of rock fragments, choose the largest rock fragment code for recording. Determine abundance from the total percentage of rock fragments. For example, in a silt loam horizon with 15% gravel, 15% cobble and 10% boulder, use (C)ZL (total rock fragments 40%, largest co-dominant fraction cobble).\nThe rock fragment component of soils is sometimes referred to as the ‘soil skeleton’, and horizons with &gt;35% rock fragments are sometimes called ‘skeletal’. This nomenclature can be modified with reference to the fine-earth fraction texture group, e.g. ‘sandy-skeletal’.\nConventions for describing rock fragment abundance, size, shape, lithology and distribution are outlined in Section 13.2.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 15.4: Visually estimating rock fragments\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a pit face or exposure, in situ rock fragment abundance can be assessed using the visual aids in Section E.2.2.3. The range boundaries in Table 15.6 can also be recognised with the following:\n\n35% by volume rock fragments approximately represents the boundary between materials in which the fragments seem to be entirely ‘floating’ in the fine-earth matrix, and materials in which rock fragments are to some extent touching one another.\n70% by volume rock fragments approximately represents the boundary beyond which individual rock fragments are in complete contact, and any fine earth is confined to interstices.\n\nMore reliable assessments of abundance require sampling and sieving (see Appendix C).\n\n\n\n\n15.1.2.1 Gravel fraction modifiers\nThe gravel fraction can optionally be subdivided into fine, medium and coarse gravel, much like the sand fraction (see Section 15.1.1.1). These codes, listed in Table 15.7, can be appended to the G code as a prefix e.g. KG for coarse gravel. Only use a modifier when confident that ≥ 50% of the gravel fraction will fall into the modifier’s size range.\n\n\n\n\nTable 15.7: Gravel fraction modifiers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nF\nFine\nGravel is dominantly ≥ 2–&lt; 6 mm\n\n\nM\nMedium\nGravel is dominantly ≥ 6–&lt; 20 mm\n\n\nK\nCoarse\nGravel is dominantly ≥ 20–&lt; 60 mm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar subdivisions are not considered useful for the cobble or boulder fractions.\n\n\n\n15.1.3 Organic materials\nWhere organic materials occupy more than 17% of the horizon volume, their presence should be signified in the texture code. Use either the the H Humose or P Peaty codes from Table 15.8, choosing the code that describes the majority of the organic material, and apply it using the conventions in Table 15.9.\n\n\n\n\nTable 15.8: Organic matter types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nH\nHumose\nComprises organic matter decomposing under aerated conditions\n\n\nP\nPeaty\nComprises organic matter decomposing under saturated conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 15.9: Organic code rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent\nConvention\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt; 17%\nDo not append\nCL\nclay loam with little organic material\n\n\n≥ 17–&lt; 30%\nAppend as suffix\nCL(P)\nclay loam with ~20% peaty organic material\n\n\n≥ 30–&lt; 50%\nAppend as prefix\n(P)CL\nclay loam with ~40% peaty organic material\n\n\n≥ 50%\nUse as primary code\nP\npeat with little to no mineral material\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a horizon has ≥ 50% organic material and &gt; 5% mineral material, mineral codes can still be appended as a suffix, e.g. H(ZL) for a forest litter layer containing some fine mineral material, or P(G) for a peat with some volcanic lapilli present.\nMore precise field estimates of organic matter content within the ranges in Table 15.6 are unlikely to be accurate; direct measurement of SOC paired with bulk density is preferred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 15.5: Soil organic matter and soil organic carbon\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil organic matter (SOM) is not estimated to a high precision in the field due to accuracy concerns. Lab-based SOM methods (e.g. wet or low-temperature combustion) also produce results that vary by soil type. As a result, soil organic carbon (SOC) is the far more frequent measurement, and is most often assessed by high-temperature combustion methods. The debate about the best way to estimate SOM from SOC remains active (Pribyl 2010; Klingenfuß et al. 2014), but the most commonly used method at present is a conversion factor of \\(SOM = 1.72 \\times SOC\\) .\n\n\n\n\n15.1.3.1 Organic material modifiers\nIf more detail is desired, organic material decomposition and origin can also be appended using Table 15.10 and Table 15.11, e.g. PHU for a well-decomposed humic peat where the contributing plant species cannot be clearly identified.\nNote that degree of decomposition is roughly analogous to the coarse/medium/fine subdivisions seen in the mineral fraction, but without strict size limits.\n\n\n\n\nTable 15.10: Organic matter modifiers - decomposition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nF\nFibric\nOrganic matter weakly decomposed and dominated by visible plant remains\n\n\nM\nMesic\nOrganic matter moderately decomposed, some visible plant structures but mostly amorphous\n\n\nH\nHumic\nPlant remains no longer identifiable, minimal fibre content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 15.11: Organic matter modifiers - origin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nM\nMoss\nOrganic materials dominantly derived from moss species e.g. Sphagnum spp.\n\n\nL\nPlants\nOrganic materials dominantly derived from non-woody plants like grasses, sedges, rushes e.g., Empodisma spp.\n\n\nT\nTree\nOrganic materials dominantly derived from woody vascular plants, e.g. Manoao/Silver Pine, Manoao colesnoi\n\n\nU\nUnknown\nOrigin of organic materials cannot be identified with confidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 15.6: Use of the von Post scale\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 10-point von Post scale of organic matter decomposition (Post 1922) was previously recommended for assessing the degree of organic material decomposition.

The method can also be used on fresh soil from representative bagged samples if field time is limited. Oven-dried samples should not be used to determine field texture, as some soil minerals clump together when heated and cannot be re-dispersed by hand.\n\nCollect a handful of soil material (no smaller than a ~30 mm block) from the target soil horizon, avoiding macrofeatures and boundary transition zones as much as possible.\nPick or sieve to remove rock fragments and other coarse material.\nIf the sample is not already moist, add small amounts of water while working the sample to bring its moisture content up. If the sample is too moist, work it in the hand until it dries. Additional soil might be required if too much water is added at once. A suitable moisture state is indicated when the sample feels moist to the touch but releases little, if any, water when squeezed.\nContinue working the sample in the hand until any structural units are broken down and the mixture is homogenised.\nAttempt to roll the sample into a ball. Can this be done easily? Does the ball hold together, or break apart under gentle pressure?\nIf a ball can be reliably formed, compress the ball between thumb and forefinger. How much force is required to compress the ball by half? Does the ball crack, or keep a smooth outer surface?\nCheck the look and feel of the ball. Does it feel gritty, floury, or buttery?

Some of the more well-known (Salley et al. 2018) are:\n\nGrading: a small amount of coarse sand in a finer matrix can cause underestimation of clay content, because the large particles are more noticeable.\nClay mineralogy: The physical properties of 2:1 phyllosilicate clays like smectite make it easier to form a ball or ribbon than 1:1 phyllosilicates like kaolinite, or clay-size secondary minerals like allophane. Thus, clay content can be underestimated in older soils weathered under humid conditions, and in volcanic ash soils.\nMicrostructure: in some soils, very small aggregates cannot be broken down by hand manipulation, or at best require dedicated working for over ten minutes per sample. This characteristic can lead to clay content underestimation - but crucially, hand texture may more closely align with in-situ physical properties than laboratory texture from chemically dispersed samples.\nOrganic matter: organic matter can lend a spongy or silky feel to a sample that may lead to overestimating silt and underestimating clay.\nSharpness: angular particles are more likely to be interpreted as sandy than silty.\nExperience and environment: workers who spend most of their time in landscapes that have a narrow range of soil textures become more sensitive to minor variations in hand-feel, and are more likely to assign unusual textures to a different texture class even when the difference is not sufficient to justify it.\n\nAll of these confounding factors can be minimised with regular training, using a wide variety of samples of known composition.",

    "text": "15.4 Recording particle size distribution\nNumerical estimates of particle size distribution for the fine earth fraction may be desired, particularly where it is known that laboratory particle size measurements will not be available. Record field estimates of clay and sand content derived from hand texturing to the nearest 1%, and work silt out by difference. It is recommended to add a separate error estimate (± x%) as an expression of confidence.\nExample: KLS, 70 ± 5% sand, 3% clay for a coarse loamy sand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 15.7: Comparing field and laboratory assessment of texture\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth field and laboratory measurements provide useful, but distinct, information on soil particle size distribution, and the two must never be treated as interchangeable. Field-estimated and laboratory-determined values must be stored separately in databases, and one must not override the other. Laboratory particle size analysis should not be used to change field texture codes; instead, a separate ‘laboratory texture’ should be generated from the analytical results. The origin of particle size estimates must always be clearly documented.\nAs discussed in Warning 15.1, fine-earth texture estimated by hand in the field can include information about other soil characteristics. Estimating particle size from hand texturing requires practice, and the ability to identify and account for these sources of interference.\nLaboratory particle size measurement also has limitations. Available methods can incorporate particle shape and mineralogy, but these methods are labour-intensive and generally confined to research contexts. High-throughput analyses are far more common and usually involve removal of organic materials and soluble minerals, along with more aggressive aggregate dispersion using shaking and chemical solutions. Below approximately 0.04 mm, the method of measurement switches from sieving to less direct observations (commonly based on settling time in a liquid column). The calculations used to translate these observations into particle size estimates make some assumptions about shape and mineralogy that may not hold true for the sample under examination (see Loveland and Whalley (2001), for a more detailed discussion).\n\n\n\n\n15.4.1 Recording whole-soil particle size estimates\nPercentage estimates of particle size require some adjustment when reporting on a whole-soil basis. Total fine earth is the sum of the mineral fine earth and the organic matter. Clay, silt and sand percentage estimates are initially reported as a fraction of the mineral fine earth only, and organic matter as a fraction of the total fine earth. Rock fragments are reported as a percentage of the whole soil volume.\nFor a worked example, take a soil with 25% clay, 35% silt, 40% sand, 15% organic matter, and 15% cobble.\n\nThe total coarse fraction is 15% of the soil volume\nThe total fine fraction is 85% of the soil volume (\\(100 - coarse fraction\\))\nThe organic fraction of the fine earth is then \\(15\\% \\times 85\\% = 12.75\\%\\)\nThis leaves the mineral fraction of the fine earth as \\(85\\% - 12.75\\% = 72.25\\%\\)\nDistributed between clay, sand and silt:\n\nclay \\(25\\% \\times 72.25\\% = 18.06\\%\\)\nsilt \\(35\\% \\times 72.25\\% = 25.29\\%\\)\nsand \\(40\\% \\times 72.25\\% = 28.90\\%\\)\n\n\nThe final whole-earth composition is 18% clay, 25% silt, 29% sand, 15% cobble, and 13% organic matter.\nReport the final results in whole percentages; the method in use can’t support any higher precision.",

    "text": "16.1 Concentrations\nSecondary soil features are bodies formed within the soil through pedogenic (natural soil-forming) processes. They contain a higher amount of a particular substance (or association of substances) and thus contrast with the surrounding material. Many of these features create barriers to water movement or alter chemistry in a way that affects soil organisms and plant root growth.\nConcentrations are secondary features that are not associated with specific surfaces within the soil - i.e. they do not form coatings on peds or void spaces but rather permeate the soil mass (compare with Section 16.2). Some concentrations contrast sharply with the surrounding soil material due to differences in colour, hardness, or composition, while others may be more subtle.\nFor rapid assessment, record concentration form and abundance percentage using Table 16.1.\nFor detailed assessment, note form, type, abundance in percentage, and size range in millimetres. Colour is not required as it is usually determined by type and may have already been recorded as a colour pattern (Section 14.3).

    "text": "Note 16.1: Lamellae and Lamina\n\n\n\n\n\nLamellae are thin bands of concentrated but uncemented soil materials, formed by pedological processes. Lamellae are usually of a finer texture than their surrounds and may also have relatively high levels of other weathering products like iron precipitates or organic matter. While their formation mechanisms are still not fully understood, presence of lamellae in a profile can signify absence of some processes (e.g. bioturbation) and presence of others (e.g. seasonal freeze/thaw activity). Lamellae usually occur horizontally or parallel to the land surface at a scale of several meters, but can exhibit a wavy character at the sub-meter scale.\nLamellae may technically qualify as distinct soil horizons. If a single lamella is evident between two contrasting horizons, then it must be described as a separate horizon rather than as a concentration. Where lamellae occur within a larger band of soil material that has consistent composition, they may be described as concentrations (e.g. LM L 10% 3-5 mm for a series of thin clay bands observed in a larger sandy layer). For more detailed discussion of lamellae, see Dijkerman et al. (1967), Rawling (2000), and Bockheim and Hartemink (2013).\nBy contrast, lamina are thin bands of unconsolidated material with contrasting texture that have been emplaced by water, wind, or pyroclastic activity and have yet to be significantly disturbed by profile development. These geogenic layers are primary rather than secondary profile features and are described using terminology from Section 13.5.1. No minimum or maximum thickness requirements are specified for lamina due to lack of data, but anecdotally they tend to be less than 5 cm thick.",

The full definitions of those horizons are available in Chapter 19.\nPans can be described in detail in terms of type, thickness, continuity, structure, strength and cementation.

Freezing and thawing can also accelerate downslope movement (solifluction), often incorporating angular, poorly sorted rock fragments into the soil.

The soil moisture status of the material should therefore be recorded at the time of description (see Section 12.6) . Consistence descriptions on the same soils at different moisture states allow the change in consistence with moisture to be described. Other consistence properties are described at reference water contents.\n\n\n17.1.2 Sampling for consistency tests\nConsistency tests should be performed down-profile, with at least one sample tested per horizon. Samples should be taken from the mid-point of each horizon. Additional samples in transition zones may also be of interest. For most of these tests, a 30 mm sample cube of soil (27 cm3) must be carefully extracted, preferably with a sharp knife. Keeping the sample size and shape consistent helps produce consistent results. Tests which involve remoulding the soil may use smaller volumes, but must use no less than ~3 cm3 (a 15 mm cube).\nWithin each horizon, the consistency tests that can and should be undertaken will depend on the cohesion (Section 17.2) of the soil materials in that horizon.

May need assessment of failure mode (Section 17.4) over a range of moisture conditions to rule out oxidic or cutanoxidic horizons. May need assessment of sensitivity (Section 17.7) and stickiness (Section 17.9) to rule out allophanic soil materials.\nPodzol Soils: may need unconfined strength (Section 17.3.1) and failure mode (Section 17.4) tests to help identify a Podzolic B horizon, as well as the presence of humus- and ortstein-pans.\nAllophanic Soils: may need assessment of sensitivity (Section 17.7) and stickiness (Section 17.9) to help confirm the presence of allophanic soil materials.\nMelanic Soils: may require stickiness assessment (Section 17.9) in the B horizon.\nSemiarid Soils: may require cementation tests (Section 17.12) to confirm fragipan absence.\nOxidic Soils: May need assessment of ped strength (Section 17.3.2), soil strength (Section 17.3.1), and failure mode (Section 17.4) over a range of moisture conditions to confirm presence of an oxidic horizon.

    "text": "17.2 Cohesion\nThe nature of the soil materials in each horizon determines what tests can and should be done. The first step is to determine if the sample is cohesive.\n\nCohesive soil materials may have plasticity and stickiness characteristics and have a strength which can be measured in unconfined compression. All listed properties, except particle packing, can be described for non-stony, cohesive soils.\nNon-cohesive soil materials have no shear resistance other than that developed by internal friction between grains. Non-cohesive soil materials, by definition, have no unconfined dry strength or plasticity, and the only property that can be meaningfully described is degree of packing or particle packing.\n\nThe range of properties which can be described in stony, cohesive soils varies with rock fragment content. In practice, this depends on the feasibility of obtaining samples for the required tests.\nThe distinction between cohesive and non-cohesive is recognised by performing remoulding (Section 17.3.3), plasticity (Section 17.8), and dilatancy (Section 17.10) tests in the following sequence (Figure 17.1). Where doubt still remains after these tests have been completed, the dry coherence test (Section 17.2.1) may be necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n  q1[\"Can a sample cube be formed from remoulded material?\"] --&gt;|yes| q2[\"Is the material plastic?\"]\n  q2 ----&gt;|yes| a1([\"**Cohesive**\"])\n  q1 --&gt;|no| q3[\"Is the material plastic?\"]\n  q3 --&gt;|yes| q4\n  q2 --&gt;|no| q4[\"Does the material have a fast positive reaction to the dilatancy test?\"]\n  q4 --&gt;|no| q5[\"Does the material have a distinctly negative reaction to the dilatancy test?\"]\n  q4 ---&gt;|yes| a2\n  q3 ----&gt;|no| a2([\"**Non-cohesive**\"])\n  q5 --&gt;|yes| a1\n  q5 --&gt;|no| a2\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.1: Determining sample cohesion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.2.1 Dry coherence\nThis test may be used as the final arbiter for distinguishing cohesive from non-cohesive soils if other test results are inconclusive, e.g. in fine silt.\nProcedure\n\nRemould a 30 mm test sample into a cube, and air-dry.\nIf the cube collapses under its own weight or after being lightly touched, treat the soil as non-cohesive.",

It provides a simple field indicator of structural integrity in cohesive soils.\n\nTest at observed field moisture condition.\nIf a test cube cannot be formed, the result is strength class 1 ‘Very Weak’ (see Table 17.2).

Work the sample until its structure is completely broken down. This may take several minutes.\nStill in the bag, remould the soil into a cube and assess its strength against Table 17.2.\nUse Table 17.6 to also record the ratio of unconfined to remoulded strength (‘sensitivity’, Section 17.7).",

    "text": "18.1 Field tests\nField tests support confident soil profile descriptions in the field by providing immediate indications of key soil chemical properties. As well as informing the description itself, the tests can help guide sampling decisions and later choice of laboratory analyses. In some cases, they can act as quality control measures (e.g. large inconsistencies in pH between field and laboratory may indicate unwanted sample oxidation in acid sulfate soils).\nField tests do have limited precision and accuracy as compared to their laboratory equivalents, due to their simplicity and short observation times. Where field tests are not conclusive, laboratory testing may still be warranted.\nField tests should be performed down-profile, with at least one sample tested per horizon. Samples should be taken from the mid-point of each horizon, extracted with clean hands or tools to avoid cross-contamination. Additional samples in transition zones may also be of interest. Properties within the upper part of the first B horizon can be diagnostic in soil classification.",

    "text": "WarningChemical safety\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of the tests in this chapter require the use of reagents that have safety risks. Users should be familiar with the safety requirements for any chemicals used in the field and appropriately trained in their safe storage, transport and use (Worksafe New Zealand 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 18.1: Field chemical tests and the New Zealand Soil Classification (NZSC)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor classifying using the NZSC, particular tests down to or at a certain depth may be helpful, and may be necessary where laboratory analyses will not be completed. At the soil order level, these are:\n\nGley Soils: Detectable ferrous ions (Fe2+) in the soil solution within the top 30 cm, signifying a reduced/anoxic environment (Section 18.1.8). A slaking test may help confirm absence of an underlying duripan (Section 18.1.10)\nUltic Soils: pH below 5.5 anywhere between the base of the A horizon and 60 cm depth (Section 18.1.1 or Section 18.1.2)\nAllophanic Soils: Strong pH response to sodium fluoride in at least 35 cm of the top 60 cm (Section 18.1.7)\nMelanic Soils: Fine earth fraction reacts with 10% HCl, signifying carbonate presence (Section 18.1.5)\nSemiarid Soils: pH of 7.5 or more within the top 90 cm (150 cm if sandy or skeletal) (Section 18.1.1 or Section 18.1.2)\nOxidic Soils: No pH response to sodium fluoride within the diagnostic oxidic horizon(s) (Section 18.1.7). Oxidic horizons may also slake rapidly under field conditions (Section 18.1.10).\nPallic Soils: Where a calcareous horizon is part of the profile, confirmation of its presence with 10% HCl (Section 18.1.5). No pH response to sodium fluoride in at the uppermost B horizon (Section 18.1.7).\nBrown Soils: at least moderate pH response to sodium fluoride in the uppermost subhorizon of the B horizon. (Section 18.1.7)\n\npH, carbonate, reactive aluminium and salinity tests are also common diagnostic features at the group and subgroup level in the NZSC.\n\n\n\n\n18.1.1 Colourimetric field pH (pHf)\nThis method, after Raupach and Tucker (1959), requires the use of a pre-made kit containing universal pH indicator, barium sulfate powder, and a calibrated colour card for interpreting results. These kits can be purchased at hardware or garden supply stores as well as specialist environmental field supply stores. The tests are simple but only precise to ± 0.5 units, and accurate (vs laboratory-based testing) to around the same degree. They are usually valid over pH range 2–10.\nEquipment\n\nField pH kit:\n\nuniversal indicator\nbarium sulfate powder\ncalibrated colour interpretation card\nsmall sample containers or plastic tray\nstirring stick\n\n\nProcedure\n\nWith clean hands or a small scoop, remove ~1–2 cm3 soil into a small container. Mix or crush the sample lightly to break open small peds.\nSprinkle the sample surface with just enough barium sulfate powder to cover. This is used to make it easier to see the pH indicator colour.\nAdd a couple of drops of pH indicator. Match the indicator colour to the card provided and record the pH of the closest match (e.g. 40 cm - 5.5). Do not interpolate between chips. Do not wait to read the pH - readings are unreliable after the sample has dried.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 18.2: Sources of variation between pHf and laboratory pH\n\n\n\n\n\nSome variability between colorimetric field and electronic laboratory pH is expected. Reasons for the variability may include:\n\nThe quality of the reagents in use, the kit’s age and how carefully it has been stored. The dye recipe needs to have been followed accurately so that the resulting colours match the calibration card. Impurities in the supplied barium sulfate powder can also cause issues. The calibration card itself needs to be printed with accurate colours, waterproofed, and not left to bleach in the sun.\nOperators need full colour vision to interpret the card correctly. While diagnosed colour blindness is relatively rare, many people have minor colour-recognition limitations without knowing it. Taking a colour vision test periodically is recommended.\nSamples taken for laboratory analysis may change pH during transport, while in storage or during sample processing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18.1.2 Field pH in water (pHfw)\npHfw is measured with a field-ready electronic pH meter. Electronic meters are precise and can usually measure the full 0–14 pH range, but are sensitive to temperature fluctuations and must be regularly calibrated. Always refer to the device manual for specific maintenance requirements.\nEquipment\n\nField-ready electronic pH meter (ideally with a temperature sensor)\nDeionised (DI) water or demineralised (DM) water\nSmall sample containers (e.g. 50 mL centrifuge tubes)\nStirring sticks\n\nProcedure\n\nWith clean hands or a small scoop, remove ~1–2 cm3 soil into a small container. Mix with DI or DM water to a loose paste, ensuring that the mix is deep enough for the pH probe to be adequately covered.\nInsert the pH probe into the sample and wait for the reading to stabilise to 1 decimal place. Stability is indicated by no change for 10 seconds. Do not stir the sample with the probe.\nRecord the reading and the depth it was taken from (e.g. 40 cm - 5.2).\nThoroughly rinse the probe before testing the next sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 18.1: Sample handling\n\n\n\nMake sure to sample with clean hands; tests can be easily contaminated by residues. In particular, sunscreens will cause a falsely high pH reading.\n\n\n\n\n18.1.3 Field pH in hydrogen peroxide (pHfox)\nField pH in concentrated hydrogen peroxide (30% H2O2) is paired with field pH in water to diagnose the presence of FeS2 (iron sulfide, or pyrite) and thus the presence of sulfidic soil materials. A significant drop in pHfox vs pHfw is considered diagnostic; see the discussion in Sullivan et al. (2018a), section A1.4.4 for further details.\nThe following method is reproduced from Sullivan et al. (2018a), section A1.4.3.\nEquipment\n\nField-ready electronic pH meter (ideally with a temperature sensor)\nConcentrated hydrogen peroxide (30% H2O2)\nDeionised (DI) water or demineralised (DM) water\nSmall sample containers (e.g. 50 mL centrifuge tubes) without lids.\nStirring sticks\n\nProcedure\n\nWith clean hands or a small scoop, remove ~1–2 cm3 soil into each tube.\nAdd enough H2O2 to cover each sample, and stir briefly. Do not cap and shake the tubes.\nAllow up to 15 minutes for any reaction to occur, especially in cool weather. Placing the rack in the sun may help progress the reaction. Note that strong reactions can sometimes occur almost instantly. Observe the samples from a short distance away and do not peer into the tubes.\nWhere reactions occur, note their violence using the scale in Table 18.1. If excessive, the reaction may be tamped down by adding a very small amount of DI water.\nWhere reactions occur, wait for them to settle and add a little more H2O2. Repeat until the reaction no longer occurs.\nOnce reactions have fully completed and the tubes have cooled, measure the pH of each sample with the electronic meter. Record to the nearest 0.1 units as for pHfw, and rinse the probe thoroughly between readings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning 18.1: Safe handling and preparation of hydrogen peroxide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcentrated hydrogen peroxide is highly corrosive. Wear safety glasses and gloves when handling, and in a field situation make sure that there is access to plenty of clean water for rinsing.\nBefore bringing H2O2 into the field, it must be buffered to pH 4.5–5.5. While stirring, add a few drops of dilute NaOH and regularly check the pH with a calibrated electrode until the correct range is reached. Allow the H2O2 to stand for 15 minutes and then recheck the pH.\nAs H2O2 degrades over time, only buffer small quantities at a time and refrigerate when not in use.\nIn the field, H2O2 containers should be kept out of direct sunlight and preferably in a small cooler, as excessive heat will cause the H2O2 to break down, releasing oxygen. This can cause its container to rupture or spray it contents when opened. Only take small containers into the field, and monitor them for signs of elevated internal pressure (e.g. bulging). Make sure all containers are clearly labelled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 18.1: Hydrogen peroxide reaction strength ratings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nN\nNo reaction\nNo fizzing or bubbling after 15 minutes\n\n\nL\nSlight reaction\nSample fizzes or bubbles slightly but does not steam\n\n\nM\nModerate reaction\nSample bubbles and steams slightly but does not completely boil. Unlikely to continue reacting if more peroxide is added\n\n\nH\nHigh reaction\nSample boils and steams but does not boil over. May continue to react when more peroxide is added\n\n\nX\nExplosive reaction\nSample rapidly boils over and puts off considerable steam; likely to continue to react when more peroxide is added\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 18.3: Incubation methods for Acid Sulfate Soils\n\n\n\n\n\nField-adjacent incubation methods are available as an alternative low-cost method of identifying acid sulfate soils. These involve minimal equipment and no hazardous chemicals, but can take up to three months to complete. See Sullivan et al. (2018b), Appendix C for further information.\n\n\n\n\n\n18.1.4 Electrical conductivity (ECf)\nThe soil solution’s ECf is an estimate of its soluble salt content, which can affect plant nutrition and water uptake. Salinity is a diagnostic criterion in the NZSC, used within the Gley, Semi-Arid, Recent and Raw soil orders. In New Zealand, a 1:5 ratio of soil to water is used in the laboratory, and so this must be matched in the field.\nEquipment\n\nField-ready electrical conductivity meter (ideally with a temperature sensor)\nDeionised (DI) water or demineralised (DM) water\nSmall sample containers (e.g. 50 mL centrifuge tubes) with lids.\nStirring sticks\n\nProcedure\n\nWith clean hands or a small scoop, place soil in each tube up to the 5 mL mark. Top up with water to 30 mL.\nCap and shake each sample vigorously for 30 seconds, then allow the samples to settle for a few minutes.\nUse the EC meter to record the solution conductivity. Report to the nearest 0.1 dS/m.\nRinse the probe thoroughly between measurements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 18.4: Conductivity units\n\n\n\n\n\nEC is most commonly reported in units of millisiemens/centimetre (mS/cm) or decisiemens per metre (dS/m), which are numerically equivalent. Other units less commonly used require specific conversion, e.g. electronic meters may report in µS/cm. 1 mS/cm = 1000 µS/cm.\n\n\n\n\n\n18.1.5 Calcium carbonate (Caf)\nWhile large chunks of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the form of shells or calcareous rocks are easy to spot, CaCO3 in the fine earth is not, and there can also be some doubt about the composition of secondary features. This test should be considered for use when working in areas where calcareous rocks occur near the land surface, where field pH &gt; 7, or when white or pale concentrations or coatings are observed - such as in some Pallic Soils and Semiarid Soils.\nCalcium carbonate reacts with acidic solutions in a neutralisation reaction, releasing water, carbon dioxide and heat as the carbonate becomes a salt (calcium chloride). The reaction is rapid and causes a soil sample to ‘fizz’ visibly. 10% (or 1 M) HCl is used for this test as it is stable, cheap and relatively safe while still reacting vigorously.\nEquipment\n\n10% or 1M Hydrochloric acid, stored in a small dropper bottle\nSmall sample containers or plastic tray\n\nProcedure\n\nWith clean hands or a small scoop, remove ~1–2 cm3 soil into a small container. Lightly crush to break up peds and/or concentrations.\nUsing a dropper bottle, add a drop or two of HCl and observe closely.\nRecord the vigour of the reaction using Table 18.2.\n\nHCl can also be applied directly to a soil profile exposure, but be careful not to include the tested patches in any soil samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning 18.2: Safe handling and preparation of HCl\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHCl is corrosive. Wear safety glasses and gloves when handling, and in a field situation make sure that there is access to plenty of clean water for rinsing.\nDo not transport large quantities of HCl, even dilute. A 25–50 mL bottle will normally last for weeks of fieldwork.\nMake sure HCl containers are clearly labelled and corrosion-resistant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 18.2: Hydrochloric acid reaction ratings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nN\nNo reaction\nNo audible or visible fizzing\n\n\nL\nSlight reaction\nFizzing faintly audible and barely visible\n\n\nM\nModerate reaction\nFizzing audible and clearly visible, small bubbles ≤ 3 mm diameter\n\n\nH\nHigh reaction\nFizzing easily audible and visible, bubbles up to 7 mm diameter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 18.5: Measuring CaCO3\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Milne et al. (1995) and some other publications (Kalra and Maynard 1991; Rayment and Lyons 2011) have attempted to use the degree of fizzing to estimate CaCO3 percentage content, the estimates and descriptions of fizzing vary and are not considered highly reliable. If a precise numeric estimate of CaCO3 percentage is required, it should be measured under laboratory conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n18.1.6 Manganese (Mnf)\nManganese-rich concentrations in soil are dark to black (sometimes bluish-black , e.g. pyrolusite (Churchman and Lowe 2012)) in colour and often very small, so may be missed or mistaken for other minerals. Manganese oxides react to H2O2 in a similar fashion to iron sulfide (see Section 18.1.3). This test uses a safer dilute H2O2 solution. This test should be considered for use where dark flecks are observed in the soil profile, particularly under imperfect to poor drainage conditions (see Section 20.1.1).\nEquipment\n\nDilute (3–6%) H2O2 solution, stored in a small dropper bottle\nSmall sample containers or plastic tray\n\nProcedure\n\nWith clean hands or a small scoop, remove ~1–2 cm3 soil into a small container. Lightly crush to break up peds and/or concentrations.\nUsing a dropper bottle, add a drop or two of dilute H2O2 and observe closely for fizzing.\nRecord the presence or absence of a reaction (e.g. 40 cm - ✔).\n\nDilute H2O2 can also be applied directly to a soil exposure, but be careful not to include the tested patches in any soil samples. Note that H2O2 will also react with organic material, so this test is not definitive in highly organic samples. Using concentrated H2O2 will increase the likelihood of misinterpretation as it will attack organic material more vigorously.\n\n\n18.1.7 Reactive aluminium by sodium fluoride reaction (NaFf)\nThis test indicates the presence of reactive hydroxy-aluminium sites on soil minerals. In New Zealand, these sites are most often associated with the presence of the nanocrystalline clay mineral allophane, along with imogolite (which has both long range and short-range order). Reactive hydroxy-aluminium sites can also be found on ferrihydrite and aluminium-humus complexes, especially in podzolic B horizons. The principle of the method is that fluoride ions at about pH 7 react with hydroxy-aluminium to release hydroxyl ions, causing a rise in pH (Fieldes and Perrott 1966). The test conditions have been chosen so that the released OH- from soils containing reactive hydroxy-aluminium turn phenolphthalein indicator reagent red (pH &gt; 9) whilst most other soils remain at lower pH values so that the indicator remains colourless.\nEquipment\n\nSaturated aqueous NaF solution (1 M NaF, maintained in the presence of an excess of undissolved NaF)\nFilter paper (Whatman No. 42 or similar) treated with phenolphthalein indicator (0.5% dissolved in 50% ethanol) and subsequently dried.\n\nThe solution and treated paper both degrade over time and should not be stored for long periods.\nProcedure\n\nWith clean hands or a small scoop, place ~0.5 cm3 soil on a piece of pre-treated filter paper. Lightly crush to break up peds and put the soil in firm contact with the paper.\nUsing a dropper bottle, add a drop or two of 1 M NaF (enough to wet the sample but not flood it) and wait up to 2 minutes.\nRecord the reaction intensity using Table 18.3 (e.g. 40 cm - M).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning 18.3: Safe handling and preparation of NaF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaF is toxic and an irritant to skin and eyes. Wear safety glasses and gloves when handling, and in a field situation make sure that there is access to plenty of clean water for rinsing.\nMake sure NaF containers are clearly labelled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 18.3: Sodium fluoride reaction ratings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\nColour\n\n\n\n\nN\nNo reaction\nNo colour change\n\n\n\nCircle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL\nSlight reaction\nPaper turns faint pink within two minutes\n\n\n\nCircle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\nModerate reaction\nPaper turns moderate pink, usually within 30 seconds\n\n\n\nCircle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH\nStrong reaction\nPaper turns dark pink, usually within 10 seconds\n\n\n\nCircle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant 18.1: Use caution interpreting the NaFf test\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe presence of alkaline conditions and/or free calcium carbonate will cause a strong false positive for this test, as the NaF will precipitate to CaF2 and yield Na2CO3. When in doubt, pre-screening with 10% HCl or a field pH test is recommended to avoid confusion.\nThe presence of organic matter can interfere with the test by buffering the pH change.\nSoils containing free aluminium (Al2+) may also react.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 18.6: NaFf test interpretation\n\n\n\n\n\nReactivity ratings used to interpret the NaFf test have been inconsistently presented over the decades since its original publication, with a tendency to get more complicated over time. The reactivity ratings presented in Table 18.3 is a return towards the simpler schemas seen in early reporting.\nWhile a strong correlation can be made between phosphate retention and NaF reaction intensity within younger tephra-derived soils (Allophanic and Pumice soil orders), the correlation does not hold across all soils.\n\n\n\n\n\n18.1.8 Reducing conditions\nReducing conditions can be suggested by low-chroma soil colours (see Note 14.2), redox mottling and other indicators of poor drainage. More confident diagnoses can be made by including field testing for reduced iron (Fe2+) as an indicator of persistently reducing conditions. Rapid testing for Fe2+ can be accomplished using 2,2’-bipyridine (previously/also known as ⍺-⍺-dipyridyl) dye, which turns pinkish red in the presence of Fe2+ (Childs 1981; Vepraskas 2015). Test strips are also commercially available and may prove easier to use in the field (Berkowitz et al. 2017). Note that these tests should only be conducted on wet or moist soils; soils that are in a slightly moist to dry state will not be experiencing reducing conditions.\nProcedure\n\nWith clean hands or a small plastic scoop, remove ~1–2 cm3 soil into a small container or a surface with a white background.\nDepending on method:\n\nIf using indicator strips, press the strip gently against a freshly exposed sample surface for a few seconds, then remove and check for colour change.\nIf using 2,2’-bipyridine dye, apply a few drops to a freshly exposed sample surface and watch for a colour change.\n\nRecord the presence or absence of a reaction (e.g. 40 cm - ✔).\n\nIn both cases work quickly because, if reduced, the sample will oxidise rapidly on excavation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning 18.4: False positives\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent contact with steel tools, previous application of 10% HCl when testing for carbonates (Section 18.1.5), and exposure to intense sunlight after the dye has been applied can all cause false positive readings for this test (Vepraskas 2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning 18.5: Safe handling of 2,2’-Bipyridine solution\n\n\n\n\n\nSome manuals have suggested the use of a spray bottle to apply 2,2’-Bipyridine to an exposure or extracted sample. This is not recommended due to the chemical’s toxicity. See National Center for Biotechnology Information (2024) for further details. A squirt bottle that does not emit a mist may be a safer choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 18.7: Other methods of assessing reduction\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent best practice for research-grade monitoring of redox potential in soils involves the use of Indicator of Reduction In Soils (IRIS) devices (Sapkota et al. 2022), sometimes in concert with electronic sensors. IRIS devices require specialist construction, installation for several weeks and careful post-processing.\n\n\n\n\n\n18.1.9 Water repellence\nWater repellence in soils results from hydrophobic organic compounds (e.g. plant leaf waxes) accumulating under a specific range of soil moisture conditions (Dekker et al. 2009; Schoeneberger et al. 2012). Repellency is thus locally and seasonally variable, and usually confined to surface layers. Water repellence is most commonly assessed by observing absorbence of distilled water and/or ethanol.\nEquipment\n\nDeionised (DI) or demineralised (DM) water, stored in a small dropper bottle\n2-molar ethanol, stored in a small dropper bottle\nSmall sample containers or plastic tray\n\nProcedure\nThis test is only reliable on dry soils.\n\nWith clean hands or a small scoop, remove ~2–3 cm3 soil into a small container. Leave the sample intact.\nUse a dropper or syringe to place 3-5 well-separated drops of distilled water onto the soil surface, from a distance of no more than 5 mm. Measure the median time it takes for the drops to be absorbed.\nIf the water drops take longer than 10 seconds to disappear, repeat the test with a fresh sample and use ethanol.\nRecord the repellence rating according to Table 18.4.\n\nNote that water repellence is affected by ambient temperature (National Committee on Soil and Terrain 2024).\n\n\n\n\nTable 18.4: water repellency ratings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nN\nNot repellent\nWater absorbs within 10 seconds\n\n\nR\nRepellent\nWater does not absorb within 10 seconds. Ethanol absorbs within 10 seconds\n\n\nS\nStrongly repellent\nEthanol not absorbed within 10 seconds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18.1.10 Rapid slaking and dispersion\nSoil aggregates can slake, or disintegrate, when wet up from a dry state, as trapped air rushes out of pore spaces. Over a longer time period, clay swelling may also contribute to aggregate breakdown by slaking. Aggregate resistance to slaking behaviour is modified by organic matter content and clay mineral type. Dispersive behaviour also causes aggregate breakdown in water but is driven by relative dominance of Na+ ions (and to some extent Mn2+ and K+) on ion exchange sites.\nField testing can reveal soils that are prone to rapid slaking and dispersion. However, soils that are only slightly prone to these behaviours may not be detected in the short assessment time described below. The test also requires dry soil samples, which can be hard to come by under New Zealand field conditions. Running the test over a 2–hour period on air-dried peds after fieldwork will often be more useful. The laboratory equivalent assessment runs over a minimum of 20 hours (Emerson 2002; Standards Australia 2017).\nEquipment\n\nDeionised (DI) or demineralised (DM) water\nShallow dish, 3–5 cm deep and 15-30 cm in diameter\n\nProcedure\n\nSet out a testing dish in a sheltered location and fill with at least 2–3 cm of DI or DM water (enough to completely cover added peds). Allow to settle.\nCarefully add one or two dry peds from each pedal soil horizon (or 1–2 cm3 of minimally disturbed material from a massive horizon), working clockwise around the dish. Minimise disturbing the water.\nObserve the samples after waiting 10 minutes. Rate their slaking behaviour using Table 18.5. Rate their dispersive behaviour using Table 18.6.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 18.5: Slaking behaviour ratings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nN\nNo slaking\nPeds remain intact.

    "text": "19.1 Primary designations\nPedological horizon notations operate as a shorthand for describing the full profile, making it easier to compare and contrast groups of profiles, and easier to classify them. Horizons are given a particular designation according to their position in the profile and according to soil properties that reflect the kind and degree of pedogenic alteration of the parent material. As designations are made in the field, they are defined mainly by morphological properties that differentiate horizons from those above or below, or from a presumed parent material. Laboratory data may be needed to confirm identification, especially in marginal cases.\nThe current scheme for New Zealand reported here was developed largely from the system used in England and Wales (Avery 1980) by Clayden and Hewitt (2015), and is broadly similar to those used overseas (e.g. WRB (2022), Soil Taxonomy (2022)). However, note that significant differences in suffix use exist between all of these systems as they have become adapted to regional conditions.\nCodes for primary horizons designations (previously known as master horizons) can be used by themselves for rapid assessment, or where criteria for more detailed nomenclature is not met. Always capitalised, they may be divided in to two organic horizons (L, O) and five mineral horizons (A, E, B, C, R) as per Table 19.1.\nTable 19.1: Primary horizon designations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nL\nLitter\nOrganic horizon accumulated under dry conditions. It is saturated with water for no more than 30 consecutive days in most years.\n\n\nO\nPeat\nOrganic horizon accumulated under wet conditions. It is saturated with water for at least 30 consecutive days in most years, or has been artificially drained.\n\n\nA\nSurface\nMineral horizon formed at the surface, or below an organic horizon. It is characterised by incorporation of humified organic matter, or properties resulting from disturbance by cultivation. The organic matter has been incorporated by biological activity, shrink-swell behaviour, or by mixing through cultivation, rather than by translocation.\n\n\nE\nEluviated\n\n\nSubsurface mineral horizon that contains less organic matter and/or iron and/or clay than the horizon immediately below, as a result of downward or lateral movement. It is identified by having ALL of the following:\n\n\nA moist colour value of 4 or more, or a dry colour value of 5 or more, with or without silty or sandy coatings observable in a dry specimen.\nHigher colour value or lower chroma combined with less well developed pedality and/or coarser texture than an underlying B horizon.\nLess organic matter and higher colour value than an overlying H, O or A horizon.\n\nThe colour of the horizon can be that of uncoated sand and silt grains but E horizons are also recognised where coats of iron oxides or other minerals mask the colour of the primary particles.\n\n\nB\nSubsoil\n\n\nSubsurface mineral horizon having little to no remnant geological structure in residual materials or fine stratification in transported materials, characterised by one or more of the following:\n\n\nIlluvial concentration of silicate clay, iron, manganese, aluminium or organic matter, alone or in some combination.\nCoatings of sesquioxides that give the horizon a lower colour value, a higher chroma, or redder hue than the horizons above and below, without apparent illuviation of iron.\nAlteration that has formed silicate clay or liberated oxides or both, and that leads to ped formation.\nEvidence of solution and removal of carbonates.\n\nA B horizon is differentiated from adjacent horizons by moist and dry colour and/or pedality and normally underlies an A or E horizon.\n\n\nC\nWeathering substrate\n\n\nUnconsolidated or weakly consolidated mineral horizon that is little affected by pedogenic processes and lacks properties of A, E or B horizons. The material may be either like or unlike that from which the solum presumably formed. A C horizon may have been modified by development of low-chroma colour and/or colour patterns caused by wetting and drying cycles, or accumulation of carbonates or more soluble salts.\n\nSome highly weathered regolithic or saprolithic materials (see @sec-pr-wdeg) are designated C rather than CR if the material does not meet the requirements of A, E or B horizons.\n\n\nR\nRock\nHard or very hard bedrock that is impracticable to dig with a spade. The rock may exhibit limited signs of weathering such as cracks, but these are generally too few and too small for significant root development. However, trees and shrubs do root into fissures in R horizons. R horizons may qualify as paralithic or lithic material.",

Soil penetration resistance exceeds 4000 kPa (penetration resistance class 7+) at soil moisture states from moist to dry; and\nMoist and dry samples slake in water within ten minutes.\n\nDensipans occur in soils with felsic parent materials. The strength is due to a close-fit arrangement of sand and silt-sized quartz particles.\n\n\nEw\nWeathered\n\n\nAn E horizon with a dominantly brownish colour. It has both of the following:\n\n\na moist chroma of 4 or more but less than 6, and\n&lt; 2% redox segregations.\n\nSkeletans may be present and the horizon normally overlies a Bt horizon containing significantly more clay.

It is black to reddish brown or dark red in colour, and a black upper part can often be distinguished from a reddish brown lower part. It lies roughly parallel to the soil surface but is commonly wavy or convolute. A Bfm horizon usually occurs as a single pan but in places it can split into two or more layers. It forms a barrier to most roots and restricts water movement.\n\n\nBh\nHumose\n\n\nDark-coloured B horizon of podzolised soils enriched in organic matter, associated with aluminium, or iron and aluminium, as a result of illuviation.\n\nIt has a moist value and chroma of 3 or less, or a value of 4 if chroma is 2, dominant in the matrix, and contains 1% or more organic carbon. The fabric has sand- or silt- size pellet-like aggregates, coats on mineral grains, or both. In some horizons (including humus-pans, Bhm), these coatings have coalesced to fill pores and cement the horizon.\n\n\nBo\nOxidic\n\n\nA strongly weathered B horizon formed in mixed crystalline iron and aluminium oxides and kaolin subgroup minerals, with low activity clay properties. It must meet all the following requirements:\n\n\nWeak or very weak primary ped and soil strength as determined by the unconfined strength test over moist to dry soil water states.\nUnconfined failure is friable or very friable over very moist to dry soil water states. Materials fail to predominantly 3 mm or smaller peds comprising silt- and sand-sized polyhedra and granules.\nPrimary peds slake in water to stable microaggregates (3 mm or smaller) which show no dispersion or only slight dispersion.\nNon-reactive or very weakly reactive to the reactive aluminium test.\nMaterials are at most slightly sticky and slightly plastic.\n\nBo horizons are clayey, with measured clay contents commonly exceeding 60%. Measured clay percentage is usually larger than in overlying A horizons, but clay increase is not a defining criterion because of the problem of quantifying clay contents in materials that are frequently difficult to disperse.\nClay coatings are either visually absent or only present at frequencies of about 1%. The Bo horizon has low activity clay accessory properties with ECEC and CEC less than 12 and 16 cmolc/kg clay respectively.\n\n\nBs\nSesquioxides\n\n\nOchreous B horizon of podzolised soils containing illuvial aluminium, iron, or both, that is closely associated, or complexed, with illuvial organic matter. The aluminium and iron is apparently mainly present as minerals with short-range order (especially allophane and ferrihydrite), though some aluminium is often present as aluminium-humus.\n\nThe designation Bs should be used for B horizons that:\n\noccur below an Ea, Bh, Bfm or a strongly acid A horizon, and\nhave a moist value and chroma both of more than 3, and\nhave a rapid positive reaction to the sodium fluoride test.\n\nIt is not possible to define the morphology of a Bs horizon such that it can be distinguished from certain Bw horizons enriched in iron and aluminium due to weathering in situ.\nCharacteristic features of Bs horizons are:\n\nReddest hue and highest chroma at the top of the horizon.\nEarthy apedal fabric with fine spheroids, or weakly developed blocks or polyhedrons.\nVery weak or moderately weak soil strength when moist or dry.\nA greasy or smeary feel when very moist.\nLow plasticity in relation to clay content.\nSand- or silt-size pellet-like aggregates, sesquioxidic coats on mineral grains or both.\n\nIn some horizons (including ortstein-pans, Bsm), coatings have coalesced to fill pores and cement the horizon.\n\n\nBt\nArgillic\n\n\nAn argillic horizon is a clay-enriched horizon. It has one of the following:\n\n\nClay coatings occur that have a waxy lustre when dry and sufficient thickness to envelop fine sand grains. Coatings occur either on peds (10% or more of the ped surfaces), or in pores (in more than one-third of the observed tubular pores) or as bridges between sand grains (in more than half of the horizon); or\nThe horizon includes at least 15% by cross-sectional area of clay-enriched lamellae (clay bands); or\nIt contains sufficiently more clay than the overlying horizon, as detected by hand texturing (5% or more), excluding any differences which result from a lithological discontinuity, and either\na. it is overlain by an eluvial (E) horizon and the upper boundary of texture contrast is abrupt or sharp, or\nb. clay coatings occur on ped or pore surfaces.\n\n\n\n\nBw\nWeathered\n\n\nB horizon that shows evidence of alteration under well aerated conditions and does not qualify as Bh, Bs or Bt.\n\nTo qualify as a Bw rather than BC or C it must meet at least one of the following requirements:\n\nRedder hue or higher chroma than an underlying horizon in similar materials (‘colour B’).\nHave spheroids, blocks, polyhedrons, tablets, prisms, columns or plates which distinguish the horizon from a BC or C horizon below (‘structural B’).\nEvidence of either partial or complete decalcification, i.e. less CaCO3 than the underlying horizon which may contain redeposited carbonates.\n\nA Bw horizon has less than 2% redox segregations. It is otherwise distinguished by the following colour requirements:\n\nWith moist values less than 5, chromas must be 3 or more.\nWith moist values 5 or more, chromas must be 4 or more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19.2.6 Transitional horizons\nTwo main kinds of transitional horizons are distinguished by specific conventions.\n\nTransitional horizons having properties of two master horizons as in gradational horizons in vertical sequence, e.g. Ap, AB, Bw. In other cases a horizon can be designated as transitional even if one of the master horizons to which it is apparently transitional is not present. For example, an AB horizon can be recognised where the underlying layer is bedrock (R), and a BC horizon can be recognised even if no underlying C horizon is identified.  Lower case suffixes are used following the two capital letters where the property denoted by the suffix applies to the whole horizon, e.g., ABg, BCt, BCx.\nTransitional horizons in which discrete parts have recognisable properties of two kinds of master horizon, e.g., where pieces of A horizon are incorporated in a B horizon or where horizons interfinger. In this case the horizon is designated by two capital letters separated by a solidus, e.g. B/C. Appropriate suffixes should be used where the components of the material are clearly identifiable, e.g. Ap/Bw.\n\nFor simplicity the capital letters for all transitional horizons are used in the order A, E, B, C irrespective of which properties dominate. For example, all horizons transitional between A and B horizons are designated AB or A/B, with suffixes as appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nTable 19.7: Common transitional horizons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nA/B\nA transitional horizon at the interface between the A and B horizons, where substantial biological mixing or dense shrink-swell cracking has produced a horizon with distinct but intermingled zones of A and B horizon material. More than one-third of the material is clearly identifiable as originating from the overlying A horizon. The B horizon material may qualify as Bo, Bs, Bw, or Bt and may or may not also have a redox suffix applied (e.g. Apg/Bg).\n\n\nAB\nA horizon transitional in character between an A and a B horizon, usually below a A horizon. It is distinguished from a B horizon by any or all of: having a darker colour due to relatively elevated organic matter, having less-developed structural units, having a structure closer in character to the overlying A horizon. An AB horizon may also lack secondary features expressed lower in the B horizon, or show weaker development of same.\n\n\nBC\nA horizon transitional in character between a B and a C horizon, usually below a B horizon. It is distinguished from a B horizon in similar material by lacking some required characteristic of colour, pedality or degree of weathering. It differs from a C horizon by having some B horizon feature, albeit weakly expressed. Note that a BC horizon can be identified in a profile without needing to first identify an overlying B (e.g. a horizon sequence of A-BC-C down-profile).\n\n\nCR\nA weakly consolidated C horizon that is sufficiently dense and coherent to form a significant barrier to roots. Soft rocks (with a hardness on Moh's scale of &lt; 3) such as shale and siltstone, and some exceptionally dense glacial tills and pyroclastic deposits are included. The material can be dug with difficulty with a spade when moist. The concept of the CR horizon is similar to that of the material underlying a paralithic contact, but without the restrictive requirement for the spacing of cracks.",

Such horizons have dark coloured coats on ped faces, in pores and on rock fragments.\n\nA cutanic horizon meets both of the following criteria:\n\nThe coatings do not have a waxy lustre when dry or are not sufficiently thick to envelop fine sand grains. Silt coatings are excluded. (Silt coatings have similar colour to the matrix, or have higher value and/or lower chroma than the matrix. On drying they may be thick enough to meet argillic horizon requirements, and have flow-like surfaces, but they have a matt rather than a waxy lustre.); and\nThe coatings have moist colour values of 4 or less, or value 5 and chroma 3 or less.\n\nIn coarse textured, apedal horizons, the translocated material can penetrate the matrix to the extent that patches of the whole horizon have the colour given above. In such cases the horizon can only be distinguished from a Bh of a podzolised soil by its relationship to adjacent horizons, or by a negative reaction to the sodium fluoride test, except for soil in volcaniclastic or pyroclastic materials.\nThe suffix is used with Bs, Bt, Bw and BC horizons and also with Ea, Eg and Er horizons below humose or peaty surface layers.\nB, C\n\n\ni\nNodular\nTo denote that the horizon contains &gt;5% by volume of nodules, subrounded or irregular segregations of iron or aluminium oxyhydroxides with some kaolin.\nA, E, B, C\n\n\nj\nJarositic\nTo denote the presence of straw-coloured jarosite, most commonly in *g or *r horizons.\nA, E, B, C\n\n\nk\nCalcareous\nTo denote an accumulation of fine-earth carbonate, CaCO3, usually detectable using field testing with HCl. The carbonate may be primary (inherited from soil parent materials) or secondary (precipitated from the soil solution). Coarse primary carbonate particles may or may not also be present but do not by themselves contribute to the definition of a calcareous horizon.\nB, BC, C\n\n\nm\nCemented\nTo denote a continuously cemented horizon that is strong enough to resist root penetration. A continuously cemented horizon is one in which the primary mineral particles are chemically bound together by precipitated secondary minerals (e.g. silica, carbonate, metal oxides, or ice). A cemented horizon is at least weakly indurated and has no (or no closely-spaced) cracks, pores or soft spots that could allow root penetration. Where the agent cementing the horizon can be identified with confidence, the ‘m’ suffix is combined with the appropriate modifier e.g. qm for a duripan.\nB, BC, C\n\n\nn\nSodic\nTo denote a significant accumulation of exchangeable sodium. Sodic soil materials have an exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) of ≥6% and an uncemented dry sample will exhibit moderate to complete dispersion.

    "text": "19.6 Lithological discontinuities\nA numbered prefix may be used to group horizons within lithological or stratigraphic zones separated by discontinuities. Such discontinuities are identified by a significant difference between adjacent horizons in the particle-size distribution or in mineralogy, that cannot be attributed to pedogenic processes. The main purpose of recognising lithological differences is to draw attention to inherited layering that can significantly influence physical properties, particularly permeability, as well as providing insight into the landscape and land-use history that can be represented by a multilayered profile.\nHorizons comprising the uppermost parent material layer are not specifically designated ‘1’, as many profiles contain no discontinuities and so the information would usually be superfluous. The subsequent layers are numbered 2, 3, etc. consecutively with depth, incrementing at each stratigraphic break. Each number may be applied to multiple adjacent horizons, until and unless another discontinuity is encountered. A change in parent material origin class (see Section 12.8.3) may often signify a discontinuity, but multiple discontinuities can exist within a sequence of the same parent material origin class, particularly in transported materials. Table 19.10 shows an example of correct usage of discontinuity prefixes in such a profile.\n\n\n\nTable 19.10: Example of a soil profile developed in alluvial deposits with multiple discontinuities related to past depositional events.

    "text": "19.7 Buried horizons\nPedogenic horizons that have been buried by deposition of additional material and little modified subsequently are called buried horizons and denoted by the prefix ‘b’. A buried horizon is obviously not in the same deposit as overlying horizons. Some buried horizons, however, are formed in material that is lithologically similar to the overlying deposit. The symbol is not used in Organic Soils or to separate an organic layer from a mineral layer.\nBuried soil horizons, even when only very weakly weathered, mark soil formation that took place through top-down processes when that parent material was at the land surface. They represent disconformities and carry information on landscape evolution, climate and time. The boundary between the top of a buried soil and an overlying tephra or other geological deposit is a paraconformity, marking a period of non-deposition (Palmer et al. 2025).\nThe notation for a buried Ah horizon in material similar to the overlying deposit is bAh, and that for a buried Ah horizon in dissimilar material is 2bAh. The horizons of a sequence of buried soils are given consecutive numbers for each soil following the prefix b, independently of the numbers for lithological discontinuities that are placed before the b. Table 19.11 shows an example of nomenclature for a buried profile.\n\n\n\nTable 19.11: Example of a soil profile developed on a lower hillslope, preserving a soil that developed in residual materials and was subsequently buried by a landslip.

When otherwise in doubt, a well developed A horizon should be assigned a drainage class one better than the horizon below it (usually a B, E, or C horizon). A poorly developed A horizon should receive the same class assignment as the horizon below. Use the ‘distinct topsoil’ NZSC diagnostic criteria to identify well developed A horizons.\nThe reasoning behind this rule of thumb is that the lack of topsoil development may be partially explained by lack of contrast in the drainage regime between the topsoil and the layer below.\n\n\n\n\n20.1.2 Profile Drainage\nThe drainage status of the profile as a whole is determined using horizon depths and per-horizon drainage ratings completed according to Section 20.1.1.\nWorkers classifying drainage for NZSC Sibling construction have no need to subdivide within the profile ratings in Table 20.2. For other types of work e.g. agricultural suitability assessment, it may be useful to recognise subgroups – e.g. for a deep-rooted, wetness-intolerant crop, there is a difference between an imperfectly drained profile that is at its worst imperfectly drained in the top 1 m, and one that has poor drainage below 60 cm.\n\n\n\n\nTable 20.2: Profile drainage rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nVP\nVery Poor\nProfiles with very poorly drained horizons starting &lt;10cm from the land surface\n\n\nPO\nPoor\nProfiles with poorly drained horizons starting &lt;30cm from the land surface\n\n\nIP\nImperfect\nProfiles with poorly drained horizons starting 30-60cm from the land surface, or Profiles with imperfectly drained horizons starting &lt;30cm from the land surface\n\n\nMW\nModerately Well\nProfiles with moderately well-drained horizons starting &lt;90 cm from the surface, or Profiles with poorly-drained horizons starting 60-90cm from the surface, or Profiles with imperfectly drained horizons starting 30-90cm from the surface\n\n\nWE\nWell\nAll horizons starting within 90cm of the surface are well-drained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20.1.2.0.1 Natural vs Artificial drainage\nProfile drainage is often modified by human activity.

    "text": "20.2 Permeability\nPermeability is the measured or estimated rate at which water moves through the soil under ‘free-draining’ conditions - i.e., in the absence of barriers and in an unsaturated state. Like drainage, permeability is assessed first on a per-horizon basis before the profile as a whole is considered.\nPermeability can be measured directly, and while this data is always preferred, the measurement process is time-consuming and labour intensive. As a result, a great deal of research effort has been directed towards developing reliable estimates of permeability for New Zealand soils based on soil morphology (Griffiths 1991; Webb and Lilburne 2011). This section describes a method of permeability estimation based on that work.\n\n20.2.1 Horizon permeability\nFor each horizon, in the absence of direct measurements, use texture group, structure, stone content, organic matter content and unconfined strength at field condition to rate permeability using the charcteristics described in Table 20.4.\nNote that for each permeability class, topsoil horizons and soils with tephric parent materials are generally considered to be one class more permeable than described (e.g., a clayey topsoil horizon with &lt;20 mm peds would be assigned moderate permeability rather than moderately slow).\n\n\n\nTable 20.4: Horizon-level permeability classes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nPermeability\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nxs\nExtremely slow\n&lt;0.1 mm/h\n\nImpermeable horizons e.g. cemented pans, bedrock\nFluid horizons\n\n\n\ns\nSlow\n≥0.1–&lt;4 mm/h\n\nClayey horizons with apedal massive or coarse structure (&gt;20 mm peds)\nSilty or loamy horizons with apedal massive or coarse structure and firm unconfined strength under field-moist conditions\nSkeletal horizons (&gt;35% rock fragments) with dense packing\nClayey peats\nPlacic horizons\n\n\n\nms\nModerately slow\n≥4–&lt;18 mm/h\n\nClayey horizons with fine structure (&lt;20 mm peds)\nSilty or loamy horizons with fine structure and firm unconfined strength\nSilty or loamy horizons with apedal massive or coarse structure and slightly firm unconfined strength\nSandy horizons with firm unconfined strength\nLoamy or sandy peats\n\n\n\nm\nModerate\n≥18–&lt;72 mm/h\n\nClayey, silty or loamy horizons with weak unconfined strength\nLoamy horizons with fine structure and slightly firm strength\nClayey-, silty- or loamy-skeletal horizons with loose packing\nSandy-skeletal horizons with compact packing\nSandy horizons with slightly firm strength\nPeaty horizons\n\n\n\nr\nRapid\n≥72 mm/h\n\nFragmental stony horizons\nSandy-skeletal horizons with loose packing\nSandy horizons with weak or very weak unconfined strength\nHumose horizons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20.2.2 Profile permeability\nSummarising permeability at a profile level involves identifying the layer with the slowest permeability, and then identifying any significant deviations from that rating within the profile.

    "section": "20.3 Rooting depth restrictions",
    "text": "20.3 Rooting depth restrictions\nSome soils contain barriers to plant root growth that can affect some or all species, depending on the natural size of their root systems and their tolerance for particular conditions. Such barriers can include physical properties (soil firmness, buried rock or concrete), chemical properties (pH, salinity, macro and micro-nutrient levels, presence of pollutants), biological properties (pathogens, pests) and hydrological properties (excessive wetness or dryness).\nRooting depth barriers can be identified most clearly by the behaviour of living roots in the profile. Absence of roots beyond a certain depth where vegetation is present at the surface may indicate a barrier, assuming the species present normally have a deep-rooting growth habit. Roots may also be observed to grow downwards until encountering a barrier and then turn to grow horizontally, sometimes forming subsurface mats. Root density may decrease suddenly at a horizon boundary without disappearing entirely, perhaps becoming sparse and confined to voids. Significant barriers may also affect the character of vegetation at the surface, causing e.g., stunted growth.\nWhere rooting behaviour appears to be impaired, evidence of a likely cause may be inferred from the profile description, particularly:\n\nField tests for pH, salinity or reducing conditions (Chapter 18)\nStrength, penetration resistance and induration tests (Chapter 17)\nStructural characteristics, particularly the absence of peds or inter-ped spaces (Section 13.1)\nRelative abundance of rock fragments, where excess rock might be a physical barrier and also limit water retention and movement (Section 13.2)\nSoil texture, where high clay content may cause waterlogging or high sand content may limit water retention (Chapter 15)\nIdentification of pans blocking root growth, or concentrations that may suggest a chemical issue (Chapter 16)\n\nWhere these features are observed, to be considered as a potential rooting depth barrier their occurrence must usually coincide with the zone where root behaviour changes, or roots disappear. Only a few barriers (e.g. bedrock) can be considered definite regardless of whether any roots are actually present in the profile. Where no obvious restricting features are present but impeded root growth is still observable, laboratory testing may be required to investigate the cause.\nRecord rooting barrier information as type using Table 20.6 and depth encountered in cm, e.g. Br 30 cm for a shallow profile over bedrock. Rooting depths should usually coincide with a horizon boundary.\n\n\n\n\nTable 20.6: Types of rooting barrier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAc\nAcid\npH below 5.5\n\n\nAk\nAlkaline\npH above 8.0\n\n\nNa\nSaline\nEC above 0.6 dS/cm\n\n\nAx\nAnoxic\nPresence of reduced iron, or a very poor horizon drainage rating\n\n\nTx\nToxic\nPresence of a human-made pollutant at levels impacting plant growth\n\n\nNx\nNutrient\nLack of a macro- or micro-nutrient required for plant growth\n\n\nFm\nFirm\nUnconfined soil strength firm or greater\n\n\nPp\nPhysical pan\nPresence of a well-developed densipan or fragipan, or a compacted layer caused by cultivation, livestock trampling, or machinery traffic\n\n\nPc\nChemical pan\nPresence of a well-developed chemical pan e.g. duripan, iron-pan, calcrete\n\n\nSk\nSandy\nSoil texture is coarse sandy or sandy-skeletal with loose packing\n\n\nCl\nClayey\nSoil texture is clayey and structure is apedal massive\n\n\nRk\nProfile rock\nRock fragments occupy over 35% of the horizon by volume, either in the soil or in regolithic material\n\n\nAk\nArtefact\nA buried layer of anthropogenic origin is present (e.g. geofabric)\n\n\nBf\nFractured substrate\nSaprolithic, paralithic or lithic material with notable cracking is present\n\n\nBm\nMassive substrate\nParalithic or lithic material with no or mininimal cracking is present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 20.1: Biologcial impedances to root growth\n\n\n\n\n\nBiological soil features may act as restrictions on plant root growth. Examples include pathogens, root-eating pest species, and allelopathic pressures from other plant species and/or soil organisms. These are not presently included in the list of root barriers in Table 20.6, for several reasons:\n\nAbility to reliably identify these factors during field soil survey is currently limited.\nWhere present, these factors are more likely to be a whole-of-profile feature than one that appears at a particular depth.\nThese factors may only affect certain species or genera.\n\nNonetheless, if a biological root growth impedance is known to occur at a location where a soil profile is being described, it should be recorded as a free-text note. Samples taken from the profile may require careful handling, e.g. to avoid spreading a pathogen, and field equipment and clothing may require decontamination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGriffiths E 1991.

    "text": "A.1.1 Hand\nExcavation by hand is often the only viable option in New Zealand terrain, which can severely limit vehicle access. A heavy duty steel spade with a wooden handle is the default choice. Other options that might suit particular environments include long-handled fencing spades and narrow trenching shovels. A breaker bar or crowbar may also be needed to loosen the soil before excavating.\nHand augers are common tools for rapid profile extraction, but with the exception of gouge augers for soft muds, the degree to which they disturb the soil profile means that they are better off as an accessory tool. Augering is best confined to well-understood landscapes where quick cores are used to confirm that observations made in nearby pits are representative of the area being sampled. Auger heads useful for soil observations include\n\n50 - 100 mm heads for loamy to light clayey soils\n30 - 50 mm heads for lightly gravelly soils\nopen-ended heads for augering in sands and fine gravels\ngouge augers for sampling soft muds\n\nExtendable systems are useful for reaching target depths &gt; 1 m, and systems with shorter rods may offer a better ergonomic experience for shorter workers. Augering safely and efficiently becomes difficult when the handles are above the base of the user’s ribcage.\nC2 (Table 10.3) style tube samplers can be manually inserted with a steel post driver and sampling depths of up to 1 m are usually achievable.\n\n\nA.1.2 Mechanical\nMechanical post drivers can be adapted to push C2 sampling tubes in as deep as 1.5 m, provided the substrate is minimally stony and soil moisture conditions are favourable. Sampling in 30-50 cm sections may be necessary in some cases.\n\n\n\nA researcher using a post driver to extract a [C1]{.ceg} style core in the upper Rangitikei River valley.\n\n\nSampling in gravelly, dry-clayey or hard-setting soils may not be feasible without the use of an excavator. Compact models that can be moved on a light trailer are preferred. A narrow bucket gives the operator a choice of pit sizes.\n\n\n\nA pedologist is seen operating a small mechanical excavator to open up a large sampling pit on an alluvial plain in Northland.\n\n\nFor deeper sampling, or work in saturated soils, consider the use of vehicle-mounted dual tube sampling systems, where a C1 core is lined with a removable plastic tube. These are usually pushed into the soil with a hydraulic hammer and the more complex systems can sample to well over 10 m. Another option is vacuum-assisted coring for working below the water table.\nMechanical screw augers are not recommended as they disturb the soil profile too much for a reliable description. Hollow-core screw augers, however, may be able to minimise such disturbance.",

Stand well back and where possible, slightly uphill.\n1 clear photo of the ground condition around the profile, including a measuring tape or stick for scale.\n1 clear photo of the extracted profile or exposure with a measuring tape for scale. Ideally take this photograph before describing the profile, so it can be viewed in a minimally disturbed state.\n3-4 closeup photos of the profile, capturing 30-40 cm depth ranges. These should slightly overlap.\n\nConsider the use of a small whiteboard to include the site identifier and date in at least the profile photo. Any further photos of e.g. concretions or other distinctive soil features are optional.\nProfile photographs should be taken in clear sunlight with the light behind the photographer, or in full shade. Avoid dappled or dim light, or angled shadows. Note that high-visibility clothing can sometimes reflect light onto profiles in a way that distorts colour.\nUsing a dedicated field data recording app to take photographs can ensure that they are always associated with the correct site identifier. Otherwise, photographs should be organised on a per profile basis as soon as possible after fieldwork. The quickest method is simply to place them in a folder named after the site identifier. Renaming image files and/or adding subject-matter tags can be useful for longer-term storage, but the process can be time-consuming.\n\nB.3.1 Photographic equipment\nMost users will default to their smartphone camera.

    "text": "C.1.1 Digging a standard pit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant C.1: Excavation safety\n\n\n\nDigging larger soil pits involves safety risks. Make yourself aware of the advice provided by WorkSafe New Zealand around managing excavations, and your responsibilities (WorkSafe New Zealand 2017).\n\n\n\nPre-screen potential excavations for buried infrastructure. Use ‘dial before you dig’ services and ideally a pipe/cable locator. On farms away from urban services, talk to the landholder about the locations of water supply pipes, gas-line easements and similar.\nOn flat land, choose a pit orientation that will create optimal lighting conditions on the main face. On sloping land above ~10 degrees, orient the pit against the slope to minimise effort and keep the pit structure safe.\nExcavate a large enough area to work in, usually 0.5-1.0 m wide.\n\nWork towards a target depth of 1 m at the main face (or at the very least, the top of the B horizon), leaving steps for access and benching side walls to minimise collapse risk.\nPlace spoil to one side on a tarpaulin, far enough back from the edge that it won’t fall back in. Don’t place spoil uphill.\nIdeally, separate top and subsoil for refilling.\nAvoid compressing or disturbing the surface above the main face.\nIf it is not safe to dig to the target depth, use an auger to extract soil materials beyond the safe depth.\nAlways stop excavating at the water table for safety reasons.\n\nClean the main face and prepare it as described for exposures (Section C.1.3).\nProceed with soil profile description and sampling.\nAfter describing, refill the pit, tamping down spoil to re-create the former surface as closely as possible.\n\nNote that pits deeper than chest height may rapidly become unsafe. Bracing is recommended past 1 m and required past 1.5 m. Highly visible fencing should be placed around the pit where it will remain open for an extended period of time (e.g. for a field day). A sump pump might be advisable to clear any infiltrating water from recent rainfall.\n\n\nC.1.2 Digging a minimal pit\nSmaller pits lack the safety risks of standard pits, but locations should still be pre-screened for buried infrastructure (see Section C.1.1).\n\nOn flat land, choose a pit orientation that will create optimal lighting conditions on the main face. On sloping land above ~10°, orient the pit against the slope to minimise effort and keep the pit structure safe.\nExcavate a small pit ~1 spade-width wide and 3-4 long, to at least ~0.6 m deep. Ideally the top 5-10 cm of B horizon should be exposed, so deepen the pit slightly if necessary. Place spoil to one side on a tarpaulin, separating the topsoil and subsoil.\nWhere texture and moisture conditions allow: Using the spade, gently excavate a ‘slice’ of the back pit face 5-10 cm thick. Remove the profile slices in sections, laying them out on a tarpaulin or mat.\nIf necessary, use a hand auger to pull out the remaining profile to 1.0 m, continuing to lay the samples out below the pit face slices.\nClean up the pit and photograph the inside, with a measuring tape in place. Take horizon depths from the pit face in preference to the extracted profile as they will be more accurate.\nPlace a tape alongside the extracted profile and take photographs.\nProceed with description and sampling.\nRefill the pit, restoring the former ground surface as closely as possible.\n\n\n\nC.1.3 Cleaning an exposure\n\nLocate a part of the exposure that is safely accessible. Exposures can change rapidly over short distances, so consider the landscape/landform and which section(s) of the exposure might be most representative.\nTrim back or clear overhanging vegetation.\nUse a spade to scrape back at least the first few centimetres of soil, revealing a fresh face approximately 40-50 cm wide. Try to create a roughly vertical face; this may involve excavating ‘in’ to the exposure surface.\nIf the exposure is less than 1 m tall, some minor excavation may be required to expose the profile to sufficient depth.\nUse a smaller hand tool to finish smoothing back the face (work across rather than down and avoid smearing), and then optionally use it to ‘pick out’ the right-hand half of the face in a way that reveals the soil structure in situ.\nClean off the lower parts of the exposure face, which may have become coated with material from upper horizons. This is especially important when sampling.\nAnchor a pit tape on the left side of the profile, optionally also pinning it at the base.\nIf the profile is partly or fully dry, spray it down lightly with water to bring up the colours consistently across the whole face.\nPhotograph the full profile and then zoom in on ~30 cm sections. Optionally, mark the horizon boundaries with pins and take a second whole-profile photo.\nProceed with the soil description and sampling.\nAfter describing, clean up any spoil, either infilling excavation or sweeping it back out of any adjacent drains.\n\n\n\nC.1.4 Extracting an undisturbed core\nThis procedure refers to extracting cores of 30–100 cm length and 30–70 mm diameter for profile description. See Section C.2.2 for extraction of short intact cores for soil physics analyses.\nThe device used to insert the sampling tube can be mechanical (e.g. post-hole driver or vehicle-mounted drilling rig) or manual (post hole driver, sledgehammer). These instructions are generic to the insertion device and sampling tube system in use. Instructions are not given for the use of screw augers as they do not extract a useable sample for profile morphology description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantCoring safety\n\n\n\nSample tube insertion devices can have any or all of noise, vibration, pinching, and manual lifting hazards. Pay attention to these hazards and implement protective equipment and procedures as appropriate. Hearing protection is particularly important for hammer-driven coring machines.\n\n\n\nLay out a tarpaulin, mat or 100 mm diameter plastic half-pipe to hold the extracted soil.\nIf working in a new area, conduct a test auger as per Section C.1.5 to assess the soil conditions. Excessive moisture or high stone content may make coring difficult, and some knowledge of the soil texture and consistency will help choose an appropriate cutting tip size for the sampling tube.\nScrape back any litter layer and trim grasses from around the area to be cored.\nInsert the sampling tube using the device of choice.\nIf possible, insert a metal bar into the top of the sampling tube and twist it in place to break the soil core’s connection with the underlying material.\nIf possible, seal the top of the sampling tube to create a slight vacuum.\nUse a foot jack or similar extraction device to carefully remove the sampling tube from the ground. Mark the core hole location clearly.\nSlide the core sample back out of the top of the sampling tube (after removing the seal, if applicable). If the sample does not slide out easily under its own weight, options for extraction include:\n\nTapping on the side of the sampling tube with a rubber mallet\nShaking the tube, vertically (keep a hand over the ‘exit’ while doing so)\nTapping the ‘exit’ end firmly against a block of timber\nPushing the sample through the tube from the cutting-tip end with a wooden dowel.\nExercise these options with caution and patience to avoid plugging up the tube. Adjusting the cutting tip size and/or extracting the core in 30-40 cm sections can also be helpful.\n\nOnce the soil core is extracted, split it open lengthwise, pulling the sections apart gently rather than cutting all the way through.\nDescribe the extracted profile, allowing for limitations in the size of features visible (e.g. large structural units may not be appreciable).\nRefill the core hole as far as possible. Use a spade to collapse the top of the hole and recreate a firm surface. This is especially important in paddocks containing livestock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip C.1: Effective coring\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtract multiple cores within a 1 x 1 m block if you think short-range variation in some properties isn’t being clearly seen on a single core, or if greater sample volumes are needed.\nThe sampling tubes usually come with a set of several cutting tips that have progressively smaller diameters. Choose the largest tip size that doesn’t result in cores getting stuck.\nIf bedrock is encountered, extract the core to the depth of the bedrock, but do not try to drill into it. Note the depth reached and that bedrock was encountered.\nAvoid coring in very stony soils as the stone will damage the cutting tips.\nAlways compare the length of the core with the depth of the hole, as compression (or sometimes expansion) may occur. This will need to be accounted for in description and sampling.\nIn wet soils, if suction is still preventing effective extraction, use a hand auger to dig down beside the core and release the base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC.1.5 Hand augering\n\nLay out a tarpaulin or mat to hold the extracted soil.\nUse a spade to remove the first 10-20 cm of profile and/or an overlying litter layer. This allows for accurate determination of surface structure, and avoids having to auger through dense surface plant matter (e.g. pasture grasses).\nAuger to depth, taking care to remove the soil in small sections without overfilling the auger head.\n\nCheck the hole depth with a tape measure every 3-5 extractions, adjusting the extracted soil to match the depth achieved.\nPay attention to the ‘feel’ of the auger; this may change noticeably as new horizons are encountered or the water table is reached. You may need to adjust the amount of downward pressure in response.\n\nDescribe the extracted profile as far as possible, given that parameters like structure may not be observable using this method.\nRefill the auger hole as far as possible. Use a spade to collapse the top of the hole and recreate a firm surface. This is especially important in paddocks containing livestock.",

    "section": "C.2 Sampling the profile",
    "text": "C.2 Sampling the profile\nProfiles are sampled for laboratory analysis to quantify and extend data recorded in the field. Undisturbed samples are required for soil physical analyses, and require specific equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip C.2: Timing of soil sampling\n\n\n\n\n\nFor practical reasons related to accessibility and ease of profile exposure, most soil sampling in New Zealand is conducted in spring or autumn. Some analytes are subject to seasonal variability and the timing of sampling may need to be tailored to capture a likely maximum or minimum. Repeat sampling for monitoring should ideally be undertaken at the same time of year for each event.\n\n\n\n\nC.2.1 Sampling for chemical analysis\nThe following method is for sampling from a pit or exposure face for full characterisation of soil chemistry and mineralogy. These samples may be extracted next to hand-carved cores for soil physics, as per Section C.2.2.1.\nSample volumes should be tailored to the needs of the planned analyses, including any desire for archiving material for future use (0.5 kg is a sensible minimum). Sample volumes may need to be adjusted upwards to account for rock fragments &gt; 2 mm and water content.\n\nBefore sampling the topsoil, trim back surface vegetation with a knife or scissors.\nAim to sample continuously and sequentially down the exposed profile face, widening or deepening the sampled zone as needed to extract sufficient volume from thinner horizons.\nAim to take at least one sample from each horizon; otherwise, subdivide thicker horizons and sample in 10–30 cm vertical increments.\nAvoid sampling across thinner horizon boundaries, adjusting to avoid wavy or irregular transition zones. Transition zones &gt;5 cm thick may be sampled separately if desired.\nWhere large infill features are present, these may be avoided in favour of sampling the material that comprises the majority of the horizon. However, there is no need to attempt to separate intermixed materials in a transitional horizon (see Section 19.2.6).\nSamples should be collected into polythene bags or sealed containers with clear labels including the site identifier, depth increment, and date. Samples should be stored in a rigid, insulated container to prevent damage or exposure to temperature extremes.\nCommunicate any specific soil features relevant to sample processing and analyses to the laboratory, e.g. the presence of allophanic soil materials, rock fragments, or pedogenic features like carbonate nodules.\n\nSimilar sampling procedures can be completed using relatively undisturbed cores (Section C.1.4) but multiple cores may be required to gather enough sample volume from each horizon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipMinimal sampling\n\n\n\n\n\nTime and budget restrictions may limit the number of samples that can be taken at each profile. The following steps may be taken to progressively reduce sample counts at a profile while minimising potential data loss.\n\nRather than sampling in continuous increments, aim to take one sample from the central part of each horizon.\nPrioritise samples required for accurate soil classification.\nPrioritise sampling the topsoil, the most developed part of the B horizon, and any limiting layers (e.g. pans).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC.2.2 Sampling for physical analysis\nSoil physical analyses require minimally disturbed soil samples of a known volume. Near the surface, samples can be taken while progressively excavating a minimal pit - but deeper extraction will require access to an exposure or standard pit face.\n\nC.2.2.1 Hand-carved rings\nThis method may be applied to a wide variety of soils but performs best with moist, non-stony, loamy or silty textures.\nEquipment\n\nPit-digging tools\nMeasuring tape (1–3 m)\nMetal sampling rings (usually ~50–100 mm diameter and 30–80 mm high, with a sharp lower edge). These rings must be numbered, weighed and measured accurately prior to use.\nVaseline for lining the interior of the sampling ring (hydraulic conductivity samples only)\nSpacer that fits over the sampling rings\nWooden block larger than the sampling ring diameter\nCling film\nSnap-blade knife and thin metal paint-scraper or spatula\nScissors or secateurs for trimming surface vegetation\nPermanent markers\nData recording sheet (or spreadsheet)\n\nMethod\n\nLocate the point to be sampled. For sampling the surface or to shallow depths (e.g. 30 cm), dig a small pit ~50 x 30 cm to the target depth. For deeper sampling, dig a full pit (Section C.1.1) at least 80 cm wide and long enough that a worker can comfortably crouch to reach the lowest target depth.\nSelect the pit face from which samples will be taken. From the surface above the face, remove any litter, and carefully trim any small vegetation back to the land surface without pulling out roots. Clear an area ~20 cm wide and deep.\nPlace a measuring tape against the pit face and place markers at target depths for sampling. The markers should specify where the top of each sampling ring will sit when it is fully inserted into the soil. For sampling the centre of a depth range (either a horizon or set increment), calculate each target depth as as \\(increment\\ midpoint - (0.5 × ring\\ height)\\) (all units in centimetres).\nIf sampling the surface, no further preparation is required. If sampling begins at a depth below the surface, use a sharp blade to carve out the soil from the surface down to this depth, creating a level pedestal at least twice as wide as the sampling ring. Allow enough space for the sampling ring to be set back at least 5 cm from the pit face.\nPlace a numbered sampling ring, sharp edge down, against the prepared surface.\nUsing a sharp blade, carefully cut around the edge of the ring to a depth of about 10 mm and remove the surrounding soil. If roots are felt, cut them with secateurs at the point the liner will touch them; if stones are felt move the liner to a new position and begin again (very small stones can be picked out and the cavity they leave filled).\nPlace a spacer onto the ring (to protect its top edge) and a wooden block on top of that and press the ring down into the soil surface, taking care to keep the ring vertical. Gently press the ring into the soil using your body weight leaning on the wooden block, but only to as far as the knife has cut. For very firm soils it may be necessary to tap the block with a rubber mallet, but this should be avoided as much as possible.\nRepeat steps 6 and 7 several times, gradually cutting and pressing the ring into the soil until its top edge is a few millimetres below the soil surface. Be careful not to press too hard and collapse the front of the pit face.\nCarefully remove the block and spacer, and clear surrounding soil.\nUsing a scraper or knife, make a horizontal slice under the sample, approximately 0.5–1 cm below the bottom edge of the ring. Use the inserted tool to lift the ring and its sample out of the soil.\nTrim the soil from both ends of the sample to leave a flattish surface about 2–5 mm proud of the containing ring. Do not trim down to the very edge of the sampling ring. This helps protect the sample during transportation. Final trimming to length will be carried out in the laboratory.\nFirmly wrap the sample in cling film to prevent drying and to support the sample during transportation. Do not use a bag unless it can be airtight. Store the wrapped sample in a rigid container to protect the top and bottom surfaces during transport.\nRecord the profile identifier, horizon number, depth range sampled and ring number on the data recording sheet.\nCut the pedestal down to the next target depth and repeat.\n\nSmaller sampling rings (e.g. 40 mm x 30 mm) are considered less reliable due to their small volume. When sampling with these, take two samples from each horizon, separated vertically if the horizon thickness allows.\nFor full-pit sampling, work down one side of the pit face, leaving the other side intact for description and chemical sampling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) A partially-inserted sampling ring, with surrounding material in the process of being removed. Note the markers down-profile showing the subsequent sampling depths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) A freshly removed and untrimmed intact sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure C.1: Hand-carved core sampling in a perched-gley pallic soil near Ōtaki.\n\n\n\n\nMechanical coring systems (see Section C.1.4) can be used to extract intact soil cores suitable for bulk density determination under the right conditions. Multiple core samples collected from consistent depths are preferred to maximise reliability. For example, New Zealand’s National Soil Carbon Monitoring program samples from ten cores at each monitoring location (Mudge et al. 2025).\n\n\n\nC.2.2.2 Bulk density in stony soils\nThe following method may be applied to mineral soils with appreciable rock fragments no larger than 200 mm (gravel and cobble), and is practical down to a maximum depth of ~60 cm. The method will usually require several hours and is most efficient with two workers involved. The method can be applied on slopes up to 10 degrees and can measure total stone content as well as fine-earth bulk density.\nEquipment\n\n20x 20 cm square metal frame with anchors\nSmall digging tools\nRobust 10 mm sieve, at least 50 cm diameter\n2x large trays\n1 x scale (max weight 20 kg)\nData recording sheet\nPlastic garbage bags\nSmall beads of regular, known, size and weight (0.025 m3 or ~25 L total), stored in buckets with secure lids\nStraight-edged ruler or similar, ~3 cm x 30 cm\nBlunt-edged scoop(s)\n\nMethod\n\nLocate a sampling position and trim any surface vegetation down to the surface over a 30 x 30cm block.\nAnchor the metal frame inside the trimmed-back area.\nPlace a plastic bag over the frame and fill it with beads, using a ruler to level the beads against the frame surface.\nRemove and weigh the beads; record their weight. Place the bag and beads to one side. This measures the ‘headspace volume’.\nWith the headspace volume recorded, start excavating inside the frame.\nRemove all soil and stone into a large tray, sieving to separate the &gt; 10 mm stone.\nExcavate to a depth of 10 cm, being careful to square up the pit sides and base as accurately as possible.\nWeigh and record the sieved stones.\nWeigh and record the sieved soil (including organic material).\nCollect ~1 kg of the sieved fine soil into a labelled sample bag.\nLine the pit with a plastic bag, and fill the bag with beads, level with the frame surface.\nExtract and weigh the beads.\nRepeat steps 6-12 for each additional 10 cm increment down to 60 cm, or until the gravels become impassable. Soil and beads may have be weighed in batches.\nIf a larger pit is not available for morphology description, describe the soil profile visible within the framed pit, allowing for the limited area and depth.\n\n\n\n\nC.2.3 Composite sampling\nSample composites taken across a site or landform may be necessary for establishing areal average measurements in locally variable properties. Mechanical corers may be used, smaller C1 style corers or even a spade or trowel if only surface soils are being sampled. In either case, use the following method:\n\nWithin the target area for sampling, extract 5–25 small samples to the target depth (e.g. 10 cm, or the local depth of the first horizon).\n\nIndividual sampling points should usually be pre-determined to avoid bias, e.g. spaced out on a grid or transect.\nFor some applications, one may wish to deliberately avoid sampling through obviously non-representative materials like cowpats.\nGather a total mass of 2–10 kg.\n\nBag the samples together, clearly labelled as a composite.\nIf the total sample volume is very large, place the extracted samples into a bucket or onto a clean tarpaulin and mix to homogenise. Sub-sample the desired volume from the mixture.\n\n\n\nC.2.4 Establishing a soil monitoring plot\nThe following method is an example of a monitoring plot that can be revisited multiple times, sampling undisturbed soil from a small defined area. The example sets up a 20 x 20 m plot, but the concept can be scaled to fit smaller landforms or larger target areas like paddocks.\nOther examples of soil monitoring plot designs can be found in NEMS (2022) and Department of Conservation (2024).\nEquipment\n\n6 corner marking pegs (e.g. pigtail stakes or light waratah posts)\n10 sample point marking pegs, clearly numbered 1-10\n1x 100 m measuring tape\n1x 30 m measuring tape (minimum)\n1x compass\n\nMethod\nThis method is most easily undertaken by two people, but can be completed alone with appropriate forethought. The method requires two measuring tapes of (minimum) 100 m and 20 m length respectively, along with 6 marker pegs. The longer tape will mark the perimeter of the plot, and the shorter one diagonals from the plot center to its corners.\n\nPlace a marker peg at plot centre, and anchor the ends of both measuring tapes to the marker.\nUnreeling the 100 m tape, walk north/uphill for 10 m and place another marker. This is the ‘top of plot’ marker.\nTurn right, wrapping the tape clockwise around the marker, and measure out another 10 m. This brings one to the north-east/upper-right corner of the plot, holding a tape that has been unreeled to 20 m. Put down the 100 m reel.\nWalk back to the plot center and pick up the second tape, measuring out exactly 14.14 m back to the north-east corner.\nAt the corner, move the two tapes until both are straight and under light tension, and the 20 m mark on the first tape aligns with 14.14 m mark on the second. This is the north-east corner of the plot, mark it with a new peg.\nTake the 100 m tape and walk south for 20 m. Place a temporary marker, and then move the diagonal tape from the north-east to the south-east corner. Repeat the exercise of tensioning the tapes to locate the corner accurately, this time with the longer tape measuring 40 m.\nRepeat this exercise again at the south-west corner (60 m) and the north-west (80 m). Close the plot by unreeling the longer tape back to the top of plot marker. The tape should now be unwound to 90 m.\nCheck that the plot looks correctly square by lining up opposite diagonal corners with the center marker. All three should be in a straight line.\n\nWhen a plot is measured out for the first time, use a high-precision GPS to record the position of all markers. Photograph the plot standing back from each corner and looking in towards the centre, capturing nearby features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip C.3: Plot delineation\n\n\n\nNote that uneven terrain and vegetation can interfere with tensioning the tapes. Be patient guiding the tapes into place. Wind can also interfere and make it difficult to tension the tapes without breaking them. On windy days, anchor the longer tape with tent pegs every few metres once the plot is lined up.\n\n\nMarking sampling points\nThe 20 x 20 m plot is divided up into 2 x 2 m ‘cells’. Use a latin-square pattern to pick only one cell per row/column combination, like the one in Figure C.2. Place a numbered marker peg at the centre of each cell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure C.2: Example core diagram for a 20 x 20 m plot, showing a latin-square sampling arrangement. The positions of the plot marker pegs are shown as red dots, and the position of the tapes defining the plot bounds are shown as grey lines. A plot like this can be resampled 10 times before all 100 cells have been visited, without fear of resampling a disturbed cell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment of Conservation 2024.

    "text": "E.1.1 Slope classification\nFor most New Zealand soils communication, the Land Use Capability slope classes Section E.1.1.1 are preferred because they are familiar to a wide audience. Other systems are included here as they may be more appropriate for specific applications.\n\nE.1.1.1 Land Use Capability slope classes\nThe most commonly-used slope classification in New Zealand is the one associated with the Land Use Capability (LUC) framework. These classes were formulated primarily to support pastoral agriculture, and the class boundaries focus on slope as an activity limiter, rather than an inherent landscape property. This means that the classification can potentially underperform in landscapes where natural slopes are close to the class boundaries. This is acknowledged in the Land Use Capability (LUC) Handbook (Lynn et al. 2009) by the inclusion of various options for modifying slope class.\nThe class boundaries are reproduced from Table 26 of the LUC Handbook in Table E.1. Some generalised groupings are also included - these are discussed in Appendix 1 of the LUC Handbook but are not explicitly defined.\n\n\n\n\nTable E.1: LUC Slope Classes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nSlope angle (degrees)\n\n\n\n\nWheelable\n\n\nA\n0 - 3\n\n\nB\n4 - 7\n\n\nC\n8 - 15\n\n\nHilly\n\n\nD\n16 - 20\n\n\nE\n21 - 25\n\n\nSteep\n\n\nF\n26 - 35\n\n\nG\n&gt; 35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip E.1: LUC slope limits\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the LUC Handbook does not provide fully closed limits for slope classes. For consistency, slope class A should be considered to be 0 - ≤4, B as &gt;4 - ≤8, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nE.1.1.2 Natural Log classifications\nWork by Speight (1971) promotes the use of slope classes with natural-log derived limits on the basis that they come closest to a universal set of ‘characteristic slopes’. The limits proposed are shown in Table E.2. These classes are commonly used in Australian soil survey, and focus more on splitting up low-slope areas of the landscape. As such, these may be more useful for interpreting low-relief landscapes than the LUC slope classes.\n\n\n\n\nTable E.2: Natural-log Slope Classes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nSlope angle (percent)\nSlope angle (degrees)\n\n\n\n\nLE\nLevel\n0 - ≤ 1\n0 - ≤ 0.57\n\n\nVG\nVery Gentle\n&gt; 1 - ≤ 3\n&gt; 0.57 - ≤ 1.72\n\n\nGE\nGentle\n&gt; 3 - ≤ 10\n&gt; 1.72 - ≤ 5.71\n\n\nMO\nModerate\n&gt; 10 - ≤ 32\n&gt; 5.71 - ≤ 17.7\n\n\nST\nSteep\n&gt; 32 - ≤ 56\n&gt; 17.7 - ≤ 29.25\n\n\nVS\nVery Steep\n&gt; 56 - ≤ 100\n&gt; 29.25 - ≤ 45\n\n\nPR\nPrecipitous\n&gt; 100 - ≤ 300\n&gt; 45 - ≤ 71.6\n\n\nCL\nCliffed\n&gt; 300\n&gt; 71.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip E.2: Additional class splits\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Soil and Land Survey Field Handbook (National Committee on Soil and Terrain 2024) notes that in certain circumstances it may be useful to split the classes VG, GE and MO, at 1.8% (1.0°), 5.6% (3.2°), and 18% (10.2°) respectively. The document does not, however, elucidate those circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\nE.1.1.3 UN-FAO Classification\nThe following classification was offered by the UN-FAO Guidelines for Soil Description (UN-FAO 2006). The classes are highly discriminatory on low slopes, but lump most steeper slopes into only two categories. As such they may be of most use in irrigation planning.\n\n\n\n\nTable E.3: FAO Slope Classes (UN-FAO 2006)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nSlope angle (percent)\nSlope angle (degrees)\n\n\n\n\n01\nFlat\n0 - ≤ 0.2\n0 - ≤ 0.11\n\n\n02\nLevel\n&gt; 0.2 - ≤ 0.5\n&gt; 0.11 - ≤ 0.29\n\n\n03\nNearly level\n&gt; 0.5 - ≤ 1.0\n&gt; 0.29 - ≤ 0.57\n\n\n04\nVery gently sloping\n&gt; 1.0 - ≤ 2.0\n&gt; 0.57 - ≤ 1.15\n\n\n05\nGently sloping\n&gt; 2 - ≤ 5\n&gt; 1.15 - ≤ 2.86\n\n\n06\nSloping\n&gt; 5 - ≤ 10\n&gt; 2.86 - ≤ 5.71\n\n\n07\nStrongly sloping\n&gt; 10 - ≤ 15\n&gt; 5.71 - ≤ 8.53\n\n\n08\nModerately steep\n&gt; 15 - ≤ 30\n&gt; 8.53 - ≤ 16.7\n\n\n09\nSteep\n&gt; 30 - ≤ 60\n&gt; 16.7 - ≤ 31.0\n\n\n10\nVery steep\n&gt; 60\n&gt; 31.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE.1.1.4 Data-driven classifications\nWhere high-precision DEMs are available and the areal limits of landscapes are identified, data-driven slope classification is possible. This cannot be done universally; since the classification is an expression of local geomorphology, the area of interest must first be carefully delineated before proceeding. Classes defined in this way may be very useful in accurately defining landforms, but hard to convert to practical use.\n\n\n\nE.1.2 Aspect classification\nThe broadest aspect classification available divides the landscape into flat/sunny/shady (@tbl-aspcl-ssh). In New Zealand, ‘sunny’ is roughly ‘north-facing’.\nFor more detail, aspect data can be classified by cardinal compass direction, in 4, 8, or 16 divisions as needed (N, NEE, ENE, etc).\ncompass rose image goes here, similar to the WRB’s one\n\n\nE.1.3 Relief classification\nThe following classification system is used globally, and developed over many years (see e.g., Hammond 1954; Löffler 1977; Brabyn 1998; Speight et al. 2024).\nRelief classifications are scale-dependant; these are calculated by convention over a 600 m diameter window. The classification can be adjusted to a smaller or larger window size using the formula \\(range_{new} = range_{old} × (window_{new} / window_{old})\\), where all inputs are in meters.\n\n\n\n\nTable E.4: Relief classification\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nRange (m)\nAverage (m)\n\n\n\n\nP\nExtremely low\n≤ 9\n~5\n\n\nR\nVery Low\n&gt; 9 - ≤ 30\n~15\n\n\nL\nLow\n&gt; 30 - ≤ 90\n~60\n\n\nM\nModerate\n&gt; 90 - ≤ 150\n~120\n\n\nH\nHigh\n&gt; 150 - ≤ 300\n~200\n\n\nV\nVery High\n&gt; 300\n~500",

    "text": "Northland hills and dunes - NN\nRolling low hills of sedimentary and mafic igneous rocks mixed together and emplaced by fault movement. These materials have eroded away in some areas, revealing the underlying basement rocks, and have otherwise been punctuated by volcanic activity, creating a patchy overlay of basaltic cones and lava fields. Large coastal sand dune systems have formed on the north-west coast along with smaller sand deposits on the east coast. Low mangrove- and salt-flats fringe many of the bays and river mouths. Many small islands occur off the east coast. The region’s landscapes are older than most of the country and are unaffected by glaciation.\n\n\nWaikato to Bay of Plenty plains and volcanics - NL\nLowlands and hill country margins of the Waikato and Bay of Plenty form infilled basins and plains comprised of Late Pliocene and Quaternary volcanogenic alluvium and peats. The Kaimai and Coromandel Ranges to the east are predominately composed of Miocene and Pliocene volcanics of the Coromandel Volcanic Zone and basement greywacke (Waipapa composite terrane). Older andesitic volcanics of the Kiwitahi and Alexandra Volcanic Groups are distributed across the province and in some cases form large steep sided stratovolcanoes. Younger volcanic activity formed small cones and basalt sheets of the Auckland and South Auckland Volcanic Fields. Late Pliocene to Holocene central North Island tephras mantle slopes up to 35 degrees. Particularly on older stable land surfaces, composite tephras form deposits several metres thick.\n\n\nWaikato sedimentary hills - NW\nStrongly rolling, moderately steep to steep deeply dissected greywacke and Tertiary hill country of western Waikato (north of the Mokau River), Haupuakohe and Hunua Ranges and adjacent hill country in northern Waikato and south east Auckland. Composed of Waipapa and Murihiku terrane overlain by Tertiary sedimentary rocks predominantly of the Te Kuiti Group but overlain by Miocene rocks of the Waitemata Group in the north and Mahoenui and Mokau Groups in the south which forms the boundary with the Southern and eastern sedimentary hills province. Late Quaternary/Holocene central North Island tephras mantle slopes up to 35 degrees. Dune sands and beach deposits have formed a narrow, discontinuous strip along the west coast from Mokau to Port Waikato.\n\n\nCentral Volcanic Zone - NV\nThe geologically young landscape of the central volcanic zone is dominated by the effects of Late Quaternary volcanism and faulting associated with the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ). TVZ rocks are dominated by ignimbrites erupted from large caldera forming volcanoes that have produced a series of ignimbrite plateaux and collapsed caldera basins and associated lakes. Older calderas have been largely infilled by more recent caldera eruptions. Small areas are occupied by rhyolitic lava domes and minor andesitic and basaltic volcanoes. Tephra eruptions especially over the last 20,000 years mantle the whole region making this province unique in that, apart from on the steepest most eroded slopes, soils are not developed from the underlying rock, but from proximal tephra deposits and fluvially reworked tephras.\n\n\nStratovolcanoes and ringplains - NT\nHigh, isolated Quaternary volcanic peaks of andesite-dominated pyroclastic materials surrounded by gently sloping, dissected, tephra-covered plains constructed from repeated cone collapse events. The cone surfaces comprise a mix of scree slopes and lava flows. The ringplains are dominated by deep, extensive volcanic ash cover, with some areas of hilly, rocky lahar mounds and some areas of shallow tephra over sandy to stony debris avalanche materials. Debris avalanche deposits may be loose or welded by heat and friction into ignimbrite rock. Radial stream networks actively erode the volcanoes and surrounding plains. The central volcanoes Ruapehu, Tongariro and Ngauruhoe are high enough to be almost continually snow-covered, and Ruapehu has some active glaciation. The Taranaki ringplain has a very narrow coastline, mostly comprising cliff-backed beaches of cobble or iron-rich sands. Some limited dune accumulation can be found on the clifftops adjacent to the coast.\n\n\nNorth Island Axial Mountains - NI\nSteep to precipitous, high greywacke mountains of the North Island Main Divide and associated ranges with strong structural and lithological control of the macro-topography. Narrow ridges, rocky, outcrop-laden upper slopes, and deep V-shaped dendritic valleys are common, with some evidence of glaciation in the southern ranges. The northern mountains include some areas of more subdued terrain with rounded ridges and remnant plateaus.\n\n\nSouthern and Eastern Sedimentary Hills - NS\nExtensive, steep to very steep, strongly dissected hills of soft marine sedimentary rocks. Gentler slopes are covered by ash deposits from nearby stratovolcanoes. Southwest of the axial mountains, the hills have been continually uplifted over a long period but not strongly faulted or faulted, resulting in near-level stratigraphy and a dendritic pattern of linear valleys with sharp ridgelines, fluted sides, and narrow floors. Alluvial infill is not extensive and is usually confined to the lower reaches of major streams, and to areas that have been blocked by major earth movements. Deep-seated slumps and slips are common. Patches of a former land surface can be found as isolated tablelands. Southeast of the axial mountains, the sediments are considerably folded, faulted and crushed, creating considerable landslip hazards.\n\n\nLower North Island lowlands - NM\nFlat to strongly rolling downlands, infilled troughs and floodplains on either side of the lower North Island axial ranges. A series of uplifted marine benches and alluvial terraces are covered by extensive quartzo-feldspathic loess deposits (and fine airfall tephra, along the southern Taranaki coastline). The terraces are dissected by major rivers flowing out of the adjacent central ranges. Extensive floodplains are built below the terraces from mixed alluvia originating in the axial mountains and sedimentary hills. On the southwest coast, a large accretionary coastal dunefield reaches from Paraparaumu to Whanganui and contains high dunes, mixed-drainage sandflats, and swamps.\n\n\nSouthern East Coast Cretaceous sedimentary hills - NA\nHigh, steep hills of greywacke and crushed argillite with occasional limestone, considerably deformed and faulted by ongoing tectonic movement. Hills have narrow, sharply defined ridge crests, numerous narrow valleys and restricted areas of rolling land and terraces. Structurally controlled NE-SW trending strike ridges, cuestas and hogsbacks with pronounced dip and scarp slopes feature in some areas capped by more resistant limestones and calcareous sandstones. Steep-sided outcrops (taipos) feature in some areas where massive more competent sandstones and limestones are present.",

    "section": "Soil Setting (formerly ‘Site Data’)",
    "text": "Soil Setting (formerly ‘Site Data’)\nThis section has been loosely structured around the major soil forming factors.\n\nADD Chapter Parent material, discussing ways to record geological and lithological information. General commentary on the use of geological maps is included but there is no requirement to record geological map code or similar, due to scale and purpose differences. Two options for lithology recording are presented (NZLRI rock type, NZSC Family Rock Class). The mineralogy classes used in the NZSC are also included as an optional parameter.\nSome commentary on available research-grade rock type vocabularies is also included. Longer term, the description manual should consider adopting one of these, but they need further development.\nADD Chapter Soils, describing additional sources of New Zealand soils knowledge.\nUPDATE ‘Location of profile position’ to Location and describe modern methods of recording site location, including elevation.\nUPDATE ‘Annual precipitation’ to Climate and Weather, build out a broader discussion of recommended climate and weather parameters, and available data sources.\nUPDATE ‘Geomorphic position’ to Geomorphology, with a more structured method of geomorphology description.\n\nThe ‘P’, ‘S’, ‘E’ scales of examination previously described on p. 12 of Milne et al. (1995) are loosely retained as Landscape, Landform and Site, but the details of their expression differ.\nSlope and aspect are retained as optional measurements. How they are recorded varies with scale of examination.\nSlope length and width are no longer required to be measured in-field, as this is generally impractical and slope width has no inherent relevance to soil character. Options for computation from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) or measurement in GIS are mentioned.\n‘Wave length and amplitude’ is replaced by the simpler term ‘relief’ and is only recorded at Landscape scale. The definition is the same. A relief classification is added in Relief classification.\nAssessment of rock outcrop and boulder cover at the site is moved to Surface cover.\nGeomorphic word descriptors (p.15-22) have been regrouped into the Landscape/Landform structure the highly local ones been moved to ‘natural microrelief’, Natural microrelief.\nThe user is referred to National Committee on Soil and Terrain (2024), p. 38-41 for detailed description of drainage channels, if needed. This is optional.\n\nUPDATE ‘Vegetation’ to Biota to allow discussion of when and how to describe other soil-influencing organisms.\n\nREMOVE the vegetation description standard (p. 25-31) and replace with cross-references to appropriate existing standards. The RECCE method is now recommended for high-detail work, and the LUC Vegetation classes for routine assessment. The LCDB can be used for rapid assessment.\nRationale The measurement standards given don’t align with how vegetation is currently recorded by NZ botanists. The ‘Atkinson’ structural classes in Table 2 are not in common use and have the additional problem of grouping all forests into one category, which has very limited discriminatory power. Soils in NZ are known to be heavily influenced by specific types of past and present forest cover, rednering the scheme suboptimal.\n\nUPDATE ‘Land use and land-management practices’ to Land cover, land use, and land management. The section now suggests using the proposed NZ Land Use Classification (Law 2024) for land use and the existing Land Cover Database for land cover. Land management codes have been replaced with a discussion of potential land management practices that may be recorded (no codes are provided). The land management practice codes previously listed on p. 33-34 have been migrated to the following code lists:\n\nEvidence of drainage works affecting the site is now recorded as part of profile drainage assessment (Natural vs Artificial drainage).\nEvidence of localised human alteration to the land surface is now recorded as anthropogenic microrelief (Anthropogenic microrelief).\nMost remaining codes are now recorded as ‘recent site disturbances’ (Surface disturbances).\n\nMOVE Erosion and deposition from Soil Setting to Soil Profile.",

The diameter of the surface examined around most sites is reduced from ~100 m to ~20 m; larger areas should be assessed as Landforms.\nMOVE Chapter ‘Reference data’ into this section\n\nADD location coordinates as required metadata (Site location, and crosslink to more detailed discussion of requirements in chapter ‘Location’)\nADD Site purpose Site purpose\nADD Site selection method Site selection method\nREMOVE a requirement for survey title. This is replaced by advocating for a profile identifier that includes a project-level grouping code, and some more generic advice about identifiers.\nREMOVE requirement for soil series name and classification. These are interpretations, not metadata.\n\nADD a non-optional code-set for exposure type (Exposure type), documenting the method by which the soil was exposed for assessment (pit, auger etc).\nADD a requirement to record the maximum depth of observation (or calculate it from horizon depth data)\nADD a code list for recording the reason a soil profile did not reach 100 cm\nADD a code list for recording recent site disturbances that have the capacity to impact the soil profile description.\n\n\n\nSoil surface\n\nADD site-specific slope and aspect recording instructions. These are not optional, unlike slope and aspect at the broader landform and landscape levels. (Slope, Aspect)\nADD an assessment of surface cover types, recorded as a compositional set (types observed must add to 100%, see Surface cover). This includes surface stone and outcrop.\nREMOVE reference to ‘fresh’ or ‘aged’ samples (Milne et al. 1995, p. 35); soil descriptions should only be carried out on fresh soil materials.\nUPDATE Separate Erosion/Deposition into two sets of three-part descriptive codes to allow easier recording of distinct processes affecting the surface (Erosion, Deposition). Rapid noting of erosion and deposition can be made using site disturbance codes; these are optional extras that allow a little more detail to be communicated.\n\nUPDATE gravity-driven erosion codes for international compatibility\nADD subtypes of wind deposition for volcanic ash, sand and silt\nADD subtypes of water deposition for flood, storm surge and glacial action\n\n\n\n\nDefining soil horizons\n\nADD a clear statement about the differences between the land surface, the soil surface, and the soil mineral surface\nADD separate instructions for recording horizon depths, based on whether a large section of profile is visible and on whether detailed assessment is desired (Boundary distinctness)\nADD guidance on accurately recording horizon boundaries on steep slopes (see Important 12.1)\nCHANGE boundary shape by making ‘occluded’ its own option rather than a modifier placed on the other four categories. It is also renamed to ‘discontinuous’. This improves international compatibility (Boundary shape)\nCHANGE boundary width code ‘D - Distinct’ to ‘C - Clear’ to avoid duplicate short codes (D is also used for Diffuse).\nADD a clear statement about when to switch from recording a diffuse horizon transition to defining a new horizon. 30 cm is the proposed cutoff. (Boundary distinctness)\nREMOVE Table 3 ‘soil water state and soil water potential’ in favour of using the soil water status codes in Table 4. Applying Table 3 correctly requires a tensiometer and/or laboratory data. The schema in Table 4 aligns more closely with international soil water status description requirements.",

Modifiers are presented for subtypes of Anthropic materials. This practice is recommended as it helps when classifying Anthropic soils, provides a shorthand option for highlighting the NZSC diagnostic Fluvial Features, and adds valuable context to horizon descriptions.\n\n\n\nSoil architecture\nThis section comprises a considerable revision of the ‘Macrofabric’ section of Milne et al. (1995). Components are more clearly separated and options for both rapid and detailed assessment are given.\n\nUPDATE structure grade to describe a clear gradient of progressively stronger development (Single-grain –&gt; Massive –&gt; Weak –&gt; Moderate –&gt; Strong).\nADD structural type after the proposal of Anderson et al. (2024) to distinguish between pedogenic, geogenic, and human-induced structural units. This is optional; not recording it assumes all structures are pedogenic.\nRationale: adding this parameter allows more effective description of C and R horizon structural characteristics, and more clearly highlights human effects on structure e.g. tillage and compaction.\nADD structural unit shape ‘angular blocky’. Consistent with international standards; useful for the extremely squared-off peds that can be observed in, e.g., Pumice soils.\nREMOVE structural unit shape ‘tabular’. Exists in no other system, appears to be a synonym for platy.\nREMOVE structural unit shape ‘cylindrical’. Exists in no other system\nREMOVE structural unit shape ‘cast’.

Counting individual roots is impractical at both very small and very large size ranges. Estimating volumetric percentage of the horizon brings roots into alignment with abundance assessment of other soil components (textures, stone, artefacts, voids), allowing total soil compositional data to be calculated.\nUPDATE list of void types to provide simpler options. Rename Krotovina to Tunnel to reduce jargon.\nUPDATE Clearly separate the description of large voids from small pores.\nMOVE description of structural unit surface features, concentrations, and infilled voids to ‘Secondary Features’.\nADD optional detailed description terms for plastics.\n\n\n\nSoil colour\n\nADD clear instructions for accurately recording colour in the field, as well as notes about colour vision acuity and the use of technology like colour sensors and cameras\nADD a direct statement about the definition of the matrix colour, as it differs from most other systems which choose based on areal dominance alone.\nADD codes for colour pattern type.

Its presence at a site can still be noted using the surface cover codes (Surface cover).\nADD functional horizon definitions\n\n\n\nHorizon properties\nThis is a new section, containing the former Appendices 1 and 2 (reformatted for clarity), as well as:\n\nADD assessment of horizon-level drainage class\nADD root barriers - while they’re for base properties in S-Map rather than siblings, they do affect allowable family and sibling classes.\n\n\n\nSoil setting properties\n\nThis is a new section. Classification options for numeric landscape parameters are presented here.\n\n\n\nThe New Zealand Soil Classification\n\nThis is a new section, connecting parts of the description standard to where they might be needed to support a soil classification. Only the Diagnostic features and the Key to Orders are examined at present.\n\n\n\nNZSC Family and sibling\n\nThis is a new section, presenting the content of Webb and Lilburne (2011) updated to how it is currently used in S-Map",

Interest in updating their content is being canvassed through the external review process.\nNEW Appendix A - recommended field equipment - for excavation, measurement, small hand tools etc\nNEW Appendix B - recording data in the field. Some general commentary about paper and computers.\n\nNew advice on taking effective field photographs\nNew example data sheets (previously in the back of the document)\n\nNEW Appendix C - sampling guidance. Some parts of Appendix 9 have been moved in here. Canvassing input from a wider range of workers during the review process before building prescriptive protocols.\nNEW Appendix D - data model. Diagrams of how the data points in the document fit together in a relational database model; clear indications of must-have and nice-to-have parameters.\nNEW Appendix E - correlations. Shows how the standard can be worked in with other land assessment systems used in NZ.\nNEW Appendix F - Glossary. This will remain unpopulated until we decide how to deliver the unified soils glossary being built as part of the NZSC update.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnderson AD, Burras CL, Turk J, Young R, Jelinski N, Moorberg C, Presley D, Osterloh K, Dere A, Clark K 2024.
