    "text": "1.1 Foreword to the second edition\nThe intent of updating the New Zealand soils description standard is to produce a document that can describe a soil profile and its landscape context in a way that effectively informs agronomic, ecological, and research applications. This includes, but is not limited to, applications like\nEngineering applications are considered out of scope, but relationships can and should be drawn between this standard and e.g., International and New Zealand geotechnical standards.\nThe document aims to support the requirements of the NZ Soil Classification, and, wherever possible, be compatible with international soil description and classification standards.\nThe revised edition of the Soil Description Handbook Milne et al. (1995) has been a steady companion to the New Zealand pedologist for nearly thirty years. This should tell us something very complimentary about the quality of the original publication! Nonetheless, as time marches on, elements of the standard have become out of date and require a refresh - notably, a response to the ever-advancing use of technology in the field. Additionally, the structure and layout of the book make it somewhat challenging to develop it into a structured database capable of storing, analysing and publishing high quality soils data.\nThis update has been in the works for over five years, but has unfortunately struggled to compete with the pressing demands of our soil mapping and research workload. The past year involved a major push to get the new draft into a stable enough state that external review is now possible. A summary of the changes proposed can be seen in Appendix F. We expect the draft to continue to evolve into a final document that suits not only Manaaki Whenua’s expert pedologists, but soils workers throughout New Zealand.\nThis new draft edition of the Handbook was compiled by Lauren O’Brien, in consultation with Andre Eger, Balin Robertson, Kirstin Deuss, Thomas Caspari, Veronica Penny, Lena Reifschneider, Scott Fraser, Emily Mackay, Anthony Ward, Malcolm McLeod, Trevor Webb, and Ian Lynn. The project would not have been possible without the support of Sam Carrick, Linda Lilburne and Andrew Manderson.\nLauren O’Brien Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research 2024-11-17",

    "text": "The soil profiles that pedologists describe are components of a larger landscape, and both influence and are influenced by their surrounds. To bring structure to the information we gather about the profile surrounds, the available inputs can be grouped into ‘soil forming factors’. These are commonly conceptualised in soils literature using the ‘clorpt’ model, whereby soils are considered to be a product of interactions of Climate, Organisms, Relief, Parent Material and Time (Jenny 1941). This section is loosely organised around these factors and describes where information on them can be found (specific to the New Zealand context) and certain parameters that may (or must) be measured directly in the field.\n\n\n\n\nJenny H 1941.

    "text": "3.1.1 Recording location\nRecord X and Y location coordinates as eastings and northings using New Zealand Transverse Mercator (EPSG:2193). For Z coordinates (elevation), use the New Zealand Vertical Datum 2016 (EPSG:1169).\nX and Y precision does not need to exceed 1 m for pits, or 0.1 m for cores and auger holes. Z precision will rarely need to exceed 0.1 m.\nExample: 1586090E, 5405722N (462 m)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning 3.1: Use of WGS84\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation sensors default to the global longitude-latitude based WGS84 datum (EPSG:4326). As a global system, its maximum accuracy is around 3 m, and coordinate accuracy also degrades over time due to continental drift. This is compensated for using a date-based ‘epoch’ adjustment. Because of these limitations, WGS84 should only be used when reconciling data from multiple locations on a global scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning 3.2: Alternate geocoding systems\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternate geocoding systems involving e.g. text-based encoding or nested hashes should not be used during fieldwork. These systems are often proprietary, sometimes prone to ambiguity or edge-case errors, and at their core often wrap around WGS84 anyway. They may still be useful during data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Expected Error\nExpected horizontal error can be automatically reported by equipment, or estimated. When estimating, record in meters with a maximum precision of 0.01 (1 cm) e.g. ± 5.1 m. Record expected vertical elevation error separately in the same units, as it will differ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 3.1: Revising locations\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation data quality can sometimes be improved by revising the location data in GIS after fieldwork, with reference to e.g. satellite imagery. Where corrections are made, expected error from the measuring instrument should be overridden with a new manual estimate of expected error.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Elevation measurement\nParts of New Zealand still lack highly accurate elevation data. Record the elevation measurement method using the codes in Table 3.1 below.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Elevation data sources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\n\n\n\n\nE\nEstimate\n\n\nA\nMeasured by a calibrated altimeter\n\n\nM\nInterpolated from contour map with interval of ≤ 20 m, or extracted from similar-quality Digital Elevation Model (DEM)\n\n\nG\nMeasured using a GNSS system with an adequate 3D fix\n\n\nD\nExtracted from high-accuracy DEM (Lidar or similar)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe M code should be used for most non-Lidar DEMs, as those available for public use were constructed from interpolated contour data or other methods with comparable vertical accuracy (see Barringer et al. 2002; Uuemaa et al. 2020) .\nWhere the A code is used, the time and location of the most recent altimeter calibration should be noted.\nG type elevation measurements are unlikely to be accurate if not using a GR-type sensor (see below), and may require additional conversion to the NZ Vertical Datum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 3.2: DEMs and location\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) are used, they should be as contemporary as possible; New Zealand’s rate of landscape evolution is relatively high and these data sources will become less reliable with age. DEMs more than 20 years old should be accompanied by a vertical error estimate adjusted upwards for age.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Equipment\nUse a GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) with an expected horizontal accuracy of ± 3 m or better. Some applications may require centimetre accuracy. Record sensor type against the schema in Table 3.2.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Location data source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nGS\nSingle-band GNSS\nSatellite based location, single band\n\n\nGM\nMulti-band GNSS\nSatellite based location, multiple band\n\n\nGR\nDifferential GNSS\nSatellite based location, on-ground correction\n\n\nLM\nMulti-sensor\nCombined GNSS and other location data\n\n\nNO\nNone\nLocation determined manually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 3.1: GNSS types\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-constellation GNSS is not the same as multi-band GNSS. The former signifies access to multiple location satellite networks operated by various parties, e.g. GPS (USA), Galileo (EU), BeiDou (China). This can improve signal consistency due to having access to more total satellites, but not necessarily overall accuracy.\nMulti-band GNSS involves receiving signals from location satellites on multiple frequency bands. The extra data from each satellite can significantly improve connection reliability and accuracy, particularly when open sky is restricted by rough terrain, dense vegetation or poor weather.\nMulti-sensor GNSS involves receiving signals not just from location satellites, but from other on-ground equipment, like mobile phone towers, wifi routers and nearby personal electronic devices. These sensors can be extremely accurate in urban areas, but much less so elsewhere.\nMost consumer electronic devices capable of reporting location will be of LM type by default, unless using an app that actively forces a GNSS-only connection. At the time of writing, most of these apps can still only return GS-quality data due to hardware limitations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 3.3: Manual locations\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimating location manually using e.g. topographic maps and orienteering methods remains an option, but should usually be considered a last resort.",

    "text": "3.2 Relative location\nAbsolute locations are enhanced by information about what is nearby. This context is useful for checking that a site’s coordinates are correct and for revisiting a site in future.\n\n3.2.1 Relative elevation\nElevation above the nearest down-slope drainage (open/flowing water, swampy ground, or a closed depression) is useful for landscape interpretations. The data can also be used to group profile descriptions, for instance when identifying sets of related terraces along river systems. The drainage feature to record against must be identified by tracing a path down-slope from the observation point, and may be far from the point of observation. As such, it will normally be more efficient to estimate this parameter after fieldwork using elevation and imagery data.\nRecord relative elevation in meters, with a precision of no more than 0.01 (1 cm), e.g. 25.5 m.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 3.4: Relative elevation models\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a sufficiently detailed DEM and stream network data, a Relative Elevation Model (REM) can be constructed to estimate this parameter. The result will need to be ground-truthed.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Triangulating off local features\nAbsolute location data can be backed up by measuring to nearby permanent or long-term features. This is particularly useful for relocating long-term monitoring plots. For this to work well, features should be within ~50 m of the target location and sufficiently sturdy to last until at least the next expected visit. Examples include fencelines, buildings, roads, and rock outcrops.\nFor single-point sites, measure distance and direction using a tape and compass. Accuracy is improved by measuring to two or more features. For plot-based sites, one can measure from at least two corners to the target feature. Photographing the point/plot and reference points together is also useful.\nadd a diagram here\n\n\n3.2.3 Long-form descriptions\nFor observation points that will be revisited, record practical information about how to return. This may include landholder contact details and records of previous interactions, notes about track conditions, locked gates, and potential hazards like water crossings. Spatial data recording the track from the nearest public road to the target location is particularly valuable.\n\n\n3.2.4 Administrative location\nTagging sites with their administrative region(s) can help with discoverability (searching and filtering) in databases, and simplify information security and privacy arrangements. This does not need to be done in the field, provided accurate locations are recorded.\nIn New Zealand, relevant boundaries include Regional Council (Stats NZ 2023a) and Territorial Authority (District Council, Stats NZ (2023b)) areas. Note that these boundaries are periodically updated so need to be related to date of observation.\n\n\n\n\nBarringer JRF, Pairman D, McNeill SJ 2002.

    "section": "4.2 Landscape",
    "text": "4.2 Landscape\nThe landscape around a soil observation comprises a distinct geomorphological pattern with repeating elements. The scale of observation varies but commonly extends from a few hundred to a few thousand meters (Heck 2017). Landscapes nest within Provinces but are not exclusive to one or another.\n\n4.2.1 Parameterising landscapes\nA landscape can be described in terms of a short list of parameters: relief, characteristic slope, drainage pattern, and the landforms contained within the landscape.\n\n4.2.1.1 Relief\nRelief is the degree of separation between high and low points in a landscape. As described in (Soil and Terrain 2009, p. 45), relief can be visualised by picturing two surfaces roughly parallel to the land surface - one passing through local crests and one through local depressions. The median vertical distance between the two surfaces is the relief.\nadd a diagram here\nRelief is usually best determined from a DEM, but can be estimated in the field. Record in whole meters if estimating, e.g. 55 m. Relief classes may be applied to the recorded data; see Section 23.3.\n\n\n4.2.1.2 Characteristic slope\nThe characteristic slope is the most common range of slopes within a regional landscape. These are often controlled by local geology.\nCharacteristic slope is usually best determined from zonal analysis of a DEM-derived slope dataset, but can be estimated in the field. Estimate in the field as a median and range, in whole degrees, e.g. 25° (20-28). Slope classes may be applied to the recorded data; some options are presented in Section 23.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple characteristic slopes\n\n\n\n\n\nSome landscapes may have two or more distinct characteristic slopes, e.g. the fronts and tops of alluvial terrace elements. In this case the median will describe the dominant surface while the range will capture the steeper areas. Recording multiple characteristic slopes at landscape scale is not considered useful, as adequate context is provided by naming the landscape and its component landforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1.3 Stream channels\nNatural stream channel patterns are relevant to understanding landscape development, but are best observed remotely. They do not need to be recorded in the field. If desired, assess the landscape drainage pattern using available data sources and define it using the stream channel attributes given in Soil and Terrain (2023), p. 26-29.\n\n\n4.2.1.4 Landscape description\nFew controlled vocabularies for landscapes exist. The schema given below is provisional and based on terms seen in common use in New Zealand environmental datasets.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.2: Common Landscape terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\nSynonyms and subtypes\n\n\n\n\nMt\nMountains\nSteep to very steep, high relief (&gt;300 m), fixed and well connected stream channels, often deep\nAlps, Volcanoes, Mountain country\n\n\nHi\nHills\nGentle to very steep, moderately high to high relief (90-300 m), fixed and well connected stream channels, shallow to deep\nHillscapes, hill country, hilly land\n\n\nUp\nUplands\nGentle to very steep, low relief (30-90 m) but relatively high elevation, fixed and well connected stream channels, shallow valleys and plateaus, located among hills and mountains\nPiedmont\n\n\nLl\nLowlands\nGentle to very steep, low relief (30-90 m) and elevation, fixed and well connected stream channels, shallow to deep\nDownlands\n\n\nTe\nTerraces\nFormer plains, uplifted and sometimes covered by loess.

Slope classes may be applied to the recorded data; some options are presented in Section 23.1.\n\n\n4.3.2.2 Orientation\nFor simpler sloping landforms, record orientation as the characteristic aspect of the major part of the landform. Record median and range in whole degrees, e.g. 315 (300-330) for a roughly northwest direction. For complex landforms with a range of aspects, record the orientation of the landform’s longest axis, looking downslope (e.g. the direction in which a valley bottom is descending). Some landforms may not have an identifiable orientation (e.g. cones, saddles), in which case record NA.\nAspect classes may be applied to the recorded data; some options are presented in Section 23.2.\n\n\n4.3.2.3 Landform element\nThe following is adapted from (Soil and Terrain 2009, p. 19–26).\nA landform element is the simplest component of a landform, and some landforms are made up of only one element. Landform elements are first assigned to a morphological type - one of a series of simple shapes - at the scale of observation. These are:\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.4: Landform Element Morphologies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\n\n\n\n\nCR\nCrest\n\n\nRI\nRidge\n\n\nSL\nSlope\n\n\nFL\nFlat\n\n\nDO\nOpen depression\n\n\nDC\nClosed depression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that these are paired mirror images, e.g. a closed depression is the opposite of a crest. Each morphological type extends to a break of slope or point of 0-curvature.\nSlopes can be further refined by including information about their relationship to their neighbouring elements. Up and down slope, four options are available.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.5: Slope element relative inclination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nX\nWaxing\nelement upslope is gentler, element downslope is steeper.\n\n\nN\nWaning\nelement upslope is steeper, element downslope is gentler.\n\n\nA\nMaximal\nelement upslope is gentler, element downslope is gentler.\n\n\nI\nMinimal\nelement upslope is steeper, element downslope is steeper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree more are available across the slope.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.6: Slope element relative enclosure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nL\nEnclosed\nAdjacent slope elements face towards each other\n\n\nE\nExposed\nAdjacent slope elements face away from each other\n\n\nO\nOpen\nAdjacent slope elements face the same direction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis combination of properties gives rise to more complex shapes. For example, an open hollow could be described as an enclosed maximal slope (SL A L). A shoulder would be an exposed waxing slope (SL X E). Adding further information about slope and aspect can define a complete element. For instance, for a gently sloping, northeast facing fan - 5 40 SL N E.\nTODO add graphics",

    "text": "4.4 Other terrain parameters\nThe following terrain parameters may be useful in particular contexts.\n\n4.4.1 Slope length\nSlope length is used in assessments of erosion vulnerability. Length is measured from the point at which a slope becomes steep enough to lose soil to erosion processes (see Section 11.7), to where it levels out enough to receive soils (or to a drainage channel). This is usually impractical to measure in the field, but can be determined computationally given an appropriately detailed DEM. Alternatively, the slope length can be manually traced in GIS.\n\n\n4.4.2 Mesoscale topographic index\nThe Mesoscale Topographic Index (MTI) (Hurst et al. 2022, p. 15) is a measure of how sheltered or exposed a location is within a landscape. To measure in the field, use a compass and clinometer to measure angle to the horizon at the 8 cardinal compass bearings. Record positive values if looking up and negative when looking down. The average of the eight values defines the index, with high values signifying a sheltered area and low values signifying exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe closest automated equivalents of the MTI appear to be the ‘Morphometric Protection Index’ (MPI) as implemented in SAGA-GIS (Yokoyama et al. 2002; Conrad et al. 2015), and the ‘intensity’ output of the ‘Geomorphons’ module as implemented in GRASS-GIS (Jasiewicz and Stepinski 2013; GRASS Development Team 2023). In the case of geomorphon intensity, the output also reports the mean relative elevation in meters of the 8 defining points rather than their average angles above or below the central point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField and computer-based measurement of MTI may differ slightly. The in-field version measures against magnetic north rather than ‘map north’, which will vary with spatial data projection.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Terrain shape index\nTerrain shape index (TSI, Hurst et al. (2022), p. 15) is a localised version of MTI, where slope angles are measured at cardinal compass points 20 m from the point of observation, rather than to the horizon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TSI can also be calculated using the automated tools mentioned above, but will require a DEM with high vertical accuracy and cell size no more than 10 m.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConrad O, Bechtel B, Bock M, Dietrich H, Fischer E, Gerlitz L, Wehberg J, Wichmann V, Böhner J 2015.

    "section": "5.2 Lithology",
    "text": "5.2 Lithology\nThe specific lithology, or rock type, of the soil parent material offers a more specific and soil-relevant categorisation than geology mapping generally supplies. Lithology is generally recorded when describing the soil’s fine earth fraction, surface and in-profile rock fragments, substrate and profile-adjacent outcrops. The following options are in common use in New Zealand.\n\n5.2.1 NZLRI Rock Type\nAn identification and coding system for New Zealand rock types is available in (Lynn and Crippen 1991). This system is tuned for land resource assessment, particularly assessment of erosivity, and is used in the NZ Land Resource Inventory and Land Use Classification methodology (Lynn et al. 2009). The system is mentioned here as an option where consistency with LUC mapping is desired.\n\n\n5.2.2 NZSC Rock Class\nLevel 4 of the NZSC, the soil Family (Webb and Lilburne 2011), uses a shorter list of lithology codes along with a separate ‘origin’ code, whereas the NZLRI rock type conflates the two concepts. The lithology codes are available in Table 24.2, and the origin codes in Table 24.5.\n\n\n5.2.3 Other lithology classifications\n\n5.2.3.1 Geological vocabularies\nSeveral research-grade vocabularies for describing geology have been developed in recent years, including Geoscience Australia (2016) and McCormick and Heaven (2023). Both offer a detailed set of rock and mineral definitions in a hierarchical relationship structure, but both are currently missing one or more terms essential to the New Zealand context. Additionally, the hierarchies don’t always align cleanly with those used in New Zealand geology. The vocabularies are expected to develop over time and may be recommended in future editions.\n\n\n5.2.3.2 Silica-content classification\nSoil parent material classifications have largely focused on major geological origin (igneous, metamorphic, sedimentary), grain size, and some obvious compositional classes. (Gray et al. 2016) contend that the major differentiator for soil formation should first be silica (SiO2) content and propose an alternate lithology classification per Table 5.1 below. This is optional to record as it has not been extensively tested.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.1: Silica-content Lithology classification\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1\nExtremely siliceous\nQuartz sands, chert, pure quartzite, jasper, quartz reefs, silicified rocks\n\n\n2\nSiliceous Upper\nQuartz sandstone, quartz siltstone, unqualified quartzite and alluvial sands\n\n\n3\nSiliceous Mid\nGranite, rhyolite and siliceous tuff, arkose sandstone, most unqualified sandstone\n\n\n4\nSiliceous Lower\nAdamellite, granodiorite, dacite, monzogranite, siliceous/ intermediate tuff, most greywacke & lithic sandstone, unqualified siltstone\n\n\n5\nIntermediate upper\nSyenite, trachyte, most argillaceous rocks (mudstone, claystone, shale, slate, phyllite and schist), alluvial loams and non-cracking clays\n\n\n6\nIntermediate lower\nMonzonite, trachy-andesite, diorite, andesite, intermediate tuff, alluvial cracking clays (not black)\n\n\n7\nMafic\nGabbro, dolerite, basalt, mafic tuff, amphibolite, alluvial black cracking clays\n\n\n8\nUltramafic\nSerpentinite, dunite, peridotite, tremolite-chlorite-talc schists\n\n\n9\nCalcareous\nLimestone, dolomite, calcareous shale, calcareous sands\n\n\n10\nSesquioxide\nLaterite, bauxite, ferruginous sandstone, ironstone\n\n\n11\nOrganic\nPeat, coal, humified vegetative matter\n\n\n12\nEvaporite\nGypsum, halite, anhydrite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis system can be applied to the New Zealand context relatively easily, although class 10 may be very rare. Iron sands would map to one of classes 6 to 8, depending on deposit purity.",

    "text": "6.1.1 Global\nThe Köppen-Geiger climate classification (Köppen 1936) is the most well-known and accepted global system, and has been periodically updated (e.g. (Kottek et al. 2006; Beck et al. 2018; Beck et al. 2023)). Current maps and projections under various climate change scenarios are available from https://www.gloh2o.org/koppen/.\nIn and around New Zealand, the Köppen regions that currently occur are listed in Table 6.1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: Köppen climate regions of New Zealand and its neighbours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nLocations\n\n\n\n\nAf\nTropical, rainforest\nPacific Islands e.g. Tonga, Samoa\n\n\nAm\nTropical, monsoon\nNorthwest coast of Fijian islands\n\n\nBsk\nArid, steppe, cold\nCentral Otago, Melbourne, Northwest Victoria\n\n\nCfa\nTemperate, no dry season, hot summer\nCoastal New South Wales and southern Queensland\n\n\nCfb\nTemperate, no dry season, warm summer\nMajority of New Zealand; Chatham Islands; coastal southeastern Australia; Tasmania\n\n\nCfc\nTemperate, no dry season, cold summer\nSmall areas of North Island e.g. upper Ruahines; lower mountains in South Island e.g. Peel Range, Nelson\n\n\nDfb\nCold, no dry season, warm summer\nSheltered pockets in the Southern Alps\n\n\nDfc\nCold, no dry season, cold summer\nLower slopes of major volcanoes and the Southern Alps\n\n\nET\nPolar, tundra\nUpper slopes of major volcanoes and the Southern Alps\n\n\nEF\nPolar, frost\nAntarctica\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmap goes here\nSince most work programs will take place within one zone, regional climate rarely needs to be noted in the field.\nWhere a study area appears to deviate from a regional map, the extent and nature of the deviation should be discussed in project reporting.\n\n\n6.1.2 Regional\nVarious climate classifications specific to New Zealand have been produced (Robertson 1956; Garr and Fitzharris 1991; Sturman et al. 1999).\nNIWA have more recently published a useful regional summary classification, although it is not accompanied by spatial data.

    "text": "6.2 Specific measurements\nSome climate parameters are more directly related to soils than others, mainly through their influence on vegetation community and evapotranspiration. Spatial estimates of these parameters have been published in the NZ Environmental Data Stack (McCarthy et al. 2021), available from the MWLR Datastore. Estimates can also be constructed from local records, where these are available.\n\n6.2.1 Rainfall\nSoil moisture availability strongly influences chemical weathering in soils (Dixon et al. 2016), and in many parts of the landscape the main source of soil moisture is rainfall.\n\nTotal annual rainfall: Some soils are unlikely to form outside a particular total annual rainfall range, e.g. Allophanic soils are uncommon where total annual rainfall is less than 1000 mm (Hewitt 2010).\nRainfall seasonality: Calculated as the mean of monthly rainfall totals, divided by their standard deviation. More pronounced seasonality implies stronger soil wetting and drying cycles, which in turn influences weathering processes.\nAn alternate measurement of seasonality involves calculating the ratio of rainfall in the warmest versus the coolest three months. In New Zealand this is usually (Dec + Jan + Feb)/(June + Jul + Aug).\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Temperature\n\nMean annual temperature: The mean temperature recorded year-round.\nMean summer temperature: The mean temperature recorded over the warmest quarter of the year. In New Zealand, this is usually December-January-February. Mean summer temperature was a key parameter used by Singers and Rogers (2014) to classify NZ terrestrial ecosystems.\nGrowing Degree Days (GDD): GDD measures the total number of °C above a set minimum temperature (usually 5, 10, or 16°C). Average daily temperature (max - min/2) is used in the calculation, and where temperature is below the set minimum, 0 is recorded. Plant species have specific GDD requirements that help determine their distribution.\nFrost Days (FD): Frost days are days where the temperature drops below 0 °C, measured 1.2 m above the land surface.\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Insolation\nThe amount of solar energy received by a site, modified by terrain and cloud cover, can strongly affect plant growth and soil weathering rates.\n\n\n6.2.4 Prevailing winds\nThe prevailing wind direction, its usual strength and seasonality all affect evapotranspiration rates and even the physical development of growing plants.",

Some elements of the RECCE standard have been adopted elsewhere in this manual, where relevant to describing the landscape and land surface (Section 4.4, Section 11.3). Note that considerable botanical experience is needed to apply the full RECCE standard correctly.\nIf the soil description is being completed in the context of an LUC assessment, use the NZLRI Vegetation Descriptions available in Appendix 3 of the LUC Survey Handbook (Lynn et al. 2009). This system describes a set of 49 vegetation communities commonly found in New Zealand, grouped into five broad structural categories (grasses, crops, scrub, forest, and herbaceous). Ability to identify key local species will be required to apply the system correctly. The system can also be used for rapid vegetation assessment during other soil mapping activities.\nFor rapid assessment, use the LCDB land cover codes (Section 8.1) that relate to vegetation.",

    "text": "7.2 Soil Fauna\n\n7.2.1 Megafauna\nSoil megafauna are large species that may not be directly dependant on the soil for any part of their life cycle, but still significantly and directly affect the soil, usually by mechanical disturbance or organic material addition. In New Zealand this role was largely filled by birds and reptiles before the arrival of humans. Since then, the niche has been dominated by domesticated sheep, goats and cows, as well as feral goats, pigs and rabbits. Significant increases in the volume of animal wastes added to many soils have also occurred, most intensely on land converted to pastoral agriculture.\nThe influence of these animals is generally captured elsewhere in a soil description (e.g. Section 10.3) and so no further morphology recording requirements are defined here.\nDirect assessment of earthworm presence in the topsoil is sometimes desired (Shepherd 2000; Shepherd and Janssen 2000). Optionally, record the number of earthworms observed in a 20 x 20 cm block of A horizon. Calculate the volume of the sample examined and convert the count to a rate per cubic metre.\n\n\n7.2.2 Macrofauna\nMacrofauna are those soil-dwelling animals with a body width of ~2 - 20 mm. This includes some critical ‘ecosystem engineers’ such as earthworms, ants, and termites. These species are capable of moving huge volumes of soil around over time, and often alter the soil structure, particle size distribution and chemical status as they do. The influence of these animals is generally captured in a soil description as ‘secondary biological features’ (Section 17.5).\n\n\n7.2.3 Meso- and Microfauna\nThe soil Meso- and Microfauna are much smaller, with body widths of 0.1 - 2.0 mm and &lt; 0.1 mm respectively. They live mostly within soil pores and have little direct impact on structure. Their presence, however, is a sign that soil porosity is well enough developed to provide them with a habitat. No observational requirements are defined for Meso- or Microfauna at this time.\n\n\n\n\nHurst JB, Allen RB, Fergus AJ 2022. The recce method for describing new zealand vegetation - a manual.

    "text": "8.1 Land cover\nLand cover is the physical cover over the earth’s surface, both natural and human made. Land use is the purpose(s) for which the land is used and provides context for why a particular land cover is present. Land management describes specific activities affecting land cover, driven by land use.\nLand cover, use and management information is captured as part of soil survey when it is relevant to interpreting the landscape, landform, and soil profile description, and especially where it is likely to have affected the soil classification. Land use data is particularly important for long-term monitoring sites, where uses may change significantly between sampling events.\nLand cover in New Zealand is monitored using the Land Cover Database (LCDB, Landcare Research New Zealand Ltd (2020)). The database is used to publish a semi-automated map of land cover, derived from satellite imagery, with a minimum unit size of 1 hectare. The LCDB categories can also be applied on-ground. The categories are listed below, excluding some where it would be physically impossible to observe the soil. The first six are currently mapped to over 80% of New Zealand’s land area and so are the most likely to encounter. The full set of category definitions are available in Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research (2018).\nRecord the dominant land cover of the landform (Section 4.3).\nTable 8.1: Land Cover Database categories.

Low density ‘lifestyle’ residential areas are included where hard surfaces, landscaping and gardens dominate other land covers.\n\n\n2\nUrban Parkland/Open Space\nOpen, mainly grassed or sparsely-treed, amenity, utility and recreation areas. The class includes parks and playing fields, public gardens, cemeteries, golf courses, berms and other vegetated areas usually within or associated with built-up areas.\n\n\n6\nSurface Mine or Dump\nBare surfaces arising from open-cast and other surface mining activities, quarries, gravel-pits and areas of solid waste disposal such as refuse dumps, clean-fill dumps and active reclamation sites.\n\n\n10\nSand or Gravel\nBare surfaces dominated by unconsolidated materials generally finer than coarse gravel (60 mm). Typically mapped along sandy seashores and the margins of lagoons and estuaries, lakes and rivers and some areas subject to surficial erosion, soil toxicity and extreme exposure.\n\n\n12\nLandslide\nBare surfaces arising from mass-movement erosion generally in mountain-lands and steep hill-country.\n\n\n15\nAlpine Grass/Herbfield\nTypically, sparse communities above the actual or theoretical treeline dominated by herbaceous cushion, mat, turf, and rosette plants and lichens. Grasses are a minor or infrequent component, whereas stones, boulders and bare rock are usually conspicuous.\n\n\n30\nShort-rotation Cropland\nLand regularly cultivated for the production of cereal, root, and seed crops, vegetables, strawberries and field nurseries, often including intervening grassland, fallow land, and other covers not delineated separately\n\n\n33\nOrchards, Vineyards or Other Perennial Crops\nLand managed for the production of grapes, pip, citrus and stone fruit, nuts, olives, berries, kiwifruit, and other perennial crops.\n\n\n44\nDepleted Grassland\nAreas, of mainly former short tussock grassland in the drier eastern South Island high country, degraded by over-grazing, fire, rabbits and weed invasion among which Hieracium species are conspicuous. Short tussocks usually occur, as do exotic grasses, but bare ground is more prominent.\n\n\n45\nHerbaceous Freshwater Vegetation\nHerbaceous wetland communities occurring in freshwater habitats where the water table is above or just below the substrate surface for most of the year. The class includes rush, sedge, restiad, and sphagnum communities and other wetland species, but not flax nor willows which are mapped as Flaxland and Deciduous Hardwoods respectively.\n\n\n46\nHerbaceous Saline Vegetation\nHerbaceous wetland communities occurring in saline habitats subject to tidal inundation or saltwater intrusion. Commonly includes club rush, wire rush and glasswort, but not mangrove which is mapped separately.\n\n\n47\nFlaxland\nAreas dominated by New Zealand flax usually swamp flax (harakeke) but occasionally mountain flax (wharariki) on cliffs and mountain slopes.\n\n\n50\nFernland\nBracken fern, umbrella fern, or ring fern, commonly on sites with low fertility and a history of burning. Mānuka, gorse, and/or other shrubs are often a component of these communities.\n\n\n51\nGorse and/or Broom\nScrub communities dominated by gorse or Scotch broom.\n\n\n54\nBroadleaved Indigenous Hardwoods\nLowland scrub communities dominated by indigenous mixed broadleaved shrubs such as wineberry, mahoe, five-finger, Pittosporum spp, fuchsia, tutu, titoki and tree ferns. This class is usually indicative of advanced succession toward indigenous forest.\n\n\n55\nSub Alpine Shrubland\nHighland scrub dominated by indigenous low-growing shrubs including species of Hebe, Dracophyllum, Olearia, and Cassinia. This class is also recorded where temperature inversions have created cooler micro-climates at lower elevations e.g. the ‘frost flats’ of the central North Island.\n\n\n56\nMixed exotic shrubland\nCommunities of introduced shrubs and climbers such as boxthorn, hawthorn, elderberry, blackberry, sweet briar, buddleja, and old man’s beard.\n\n\n58\nMatagouri or Grey Scrub\nScrub and shrubland comprising small-leaved, often divaricating shrubs such as matagouri, Coprosma spp., Muehlenbeckia spp., Cassinia spp., and Parsonsia spp. These, from a distance, often have a grey appearance.\n\n\n64\nForest - Harvested\nPredominantly bare ground arising from the harvesting of exotic forest or, less commonly, the clearing of indigenous forest.\n\n\n68\nDeciduous Hardwoods\nExotic deciduous woodlands, predominantly of willows or poplars but also of oak, elm, ash or other species. Commonly alongside inland water (or as part of wetlands), or as erosion-control, shelter and amenity plantings.\n\n\n70\nMangrove\nShrubs or small trees of the New Zealand mangrove (Avicennia marina subspecies australascia).\n\n\n80\nPeat Shrubland (Chatham Is)\nLow-growing shrubland communities usually dominated by Dracophyllum spp. in association with Cyathodes spp. and ground ferns. Mapped only on the Chatham Islands.\n\n\n81\nDune Shrubland (Chatham Is)\nLow-growing shrubland communities dominated by Leucopogon spp., Pimelia arenaria and Coprosma spp., in association with sedges and scattered herbs and grasses.

    "text": "8.2 Land Use\nNew Zealand currently lacks an official land use classification framework, but a proposal has been developed (Law 2024) and can be implemented during soil survey work. As shown in Figure 8.1, the classification has three nested levels with increasing specificity. The system also allows for recording further information as ‘attributes’ of the land use (e.g tenure or management practices). This classification can be applied independent of scale, so advice on how and when to apply it to Landscapes, Landforms, and Profiles follows.\nLand use classification does not have to be done in the field provided adequate supporting information (notes and photographs) are available for later use. Given that the classification is expected to evolve over time, the observation date can be used to infer the edition in use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Overview of the New Zealand Land Use Management classification system (reproduced from Law (2024), p. 44)\n\n\n\n\n8.2.1 Land use at Landscape scale\nThe Landscape will most likely contain multiple land uses. Record the primary land use and up to two ancillary land uses, but only to the second level of the classification. Uses recorded must be considered to occupy at least 20% of the landscape under examination.\nThis parameter is optional as it may only be useful when writing high-level reporting or metadata.\n\n\n8.2.2 Land use at Landform scale\nThe Landform is a more local concept. As such it is less likely to contain multiple land uses, and these should be recorded at the third level of the classification. Record the primary land use and up to two ancillary land uses. These do not have to be contained within the land uses recorded at Landscape level, as they may be locally distinct. The uses recorded should occupy at least 20% of the landform under consideration.\nWhere more than one use occurs within a Landform, the primary use is the one considered to have had the most impact on the soil profile being described. Attribute each Landform-scale land use with the degree to which it is considered to have impacted the soil profile, using Table 8.2.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.2: Land Use impact on the soil profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nN\nNone\nThe land use has not significantly impacted the soil profile\n\n\nM\nIndirect\nThe land use has impacted flows of energy/matter into/out of the profile but not physically disturbed it (e.g. by fertiliser application or drainage alteration)\n\n\nE\nDirect\nThe land use has caused physical disturbance to the soil profile (e.g. from tillage or excavation)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample for a site on a mixed sheep and beef farm in hill country:\n\nLandscape: Series of steep valleys with some forestry blocks and new waterway exclusion fencing - 2.2 (2.1, 1.4)\nLandform: Moderate slope with pasture cover - 2.2.3 M",

    "text": "10.1 Defining the site\nSoil profiles are described at sites. The ‘site’ concept is necessarily somewhat flexible to account for the range of sampling purposes and methods. Generally speaking, it is considered to include the immediate profile surrounds, up to a radius of ~10 m. As such, it will generally nest within a landform unless the site selection method was prescriptive and landform-blind.\nLarger plots and long transects that definitely cover multiple landforms, or even landscapes, should be considered as being built from multiple related sites.\nThe soil profile description starts with an observation of the site’s surface and works down. The chief tasks are assessing the surface, delineating soil layers, or horizons, and describing their morphological character. Prior to that, some additional reference data should be recorded:",

    "section": "10.2 Reference data",
    "text": "10.2 Reference data\nReference data is metadata that clearly identifies a soil profile description. This enables linking the description to other profiles, samples, analytical results and photographs. Reference data includes:\n\nan identifier\nwho completed the description\nwhen and where it was located\nwhy the description was needed\nhow the location was chosen\n\nThese are discussed in turn below.\n\n10.2.1 Profile description identifiers\nAssign each profile description a job or project identifier followed by a sequential number, e.g. ‘ABC_001’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 10.1: Unique identifiers\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many ways to build profile identifiers. The recommendation above is a compromise between robustness and simplicity that can at least guarantee unique identifiers within an active working group, e.g. a small business.\nWell-designed databases use truly unique identifiers for every piece of data they hold. Under contemporary best practice, these are usually ‘UUIDs’, 128-bit hexadecimal codes (see Davis et al. (2024)). While technically robust, these are difficult to work with day-to-day, and most workers will find themselves preferring to interact with simpler identifiers. In a soil profile database, these should be implemented as UUID aliases. End users should primarily interact with the aliases, and the UUIDs should remain hidden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 10.2: Working in teams\n\n\n\n\n\nSemi-unique identifiers require active management when working with multiple field teams operating in parallel. This avoids the risk of two sites being given the same ID on the same day. Each team should be assigned a ‘block’ of identifiers to work through, large enough to cover the intended number of profile descriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 10.3: Other profile groupings\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may be desirable to be able to group profile descriptions in more complex ways. Examples of these might include\n\ndescriptions belonging to a transect or plot\ndescriptions representing a chrono-, climo- or topo-sequence\n\nA tagging system can be useful in these cases. Otherwise, consider whether additional custom metadata fields should be implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.2 Authors\nEach profile description must have a single responsible author. Record their name. Additional participants may also be noted.\nUse a short unique identifier for each officer, for example SMITJ for John Smith. These may be linked to a more complex user management system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution 10.1: Data privacy\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Zealand data privacy laws are strict. Personally identifying information must be stored securely and not distributed without a good reason. Personal details such as names may not be publishable without explicit consent. Data storage solutions must respect these requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.3 Location\nRecord location coordinates as eastings and northings in New Zealand Transverse Mercator, e.g 1586090E, 5405720N.\nThis is the bare minimum requirement for site location; see Chapter 3 for a more detailed discussion.\n\n\n10.2.4 Date\nRecord the date of observation using the ISO 8601 standard, YYYY-MM-DD (International Organization for Standardization 2019). Time is not essential but may be useful for correlating site descriptions with photographs.\n\n\n10.2.5 Site purpose\nThe original task for which a site was observed can affect what data is recorded and is relevant to data re-use decisions.\nRecord the reason for sampling using the schema in Table 10.1. This parameter does not need to be recorded in the field.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.1: Site purpose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\n\n\n\n\nE\nMapping exploration\n\n\nV\nMapping validation\n\n\nR\nResearch\n\n\nM\nMonitoring\n\n\nT\nReference\n\n\nD\nDevelopment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 10.4: About these categories\n\n\n\n\n\nD sites are often carried out as part of planning for a resource consent. The soil they describe may be removed or sealed after observation, limiting data re-use potential. M monitoring sites imply repeated, regular re-sampling activity and perhaps an expectation of minimal major disturbance between visits.\nV validation sites may be low-detail, as they are intended to confirm or deny a prediction. T reference sites (T for ‘type’) may be expected to have high morphological detail and a lot of accompanying analytical data, as they represent ‘ideal’ profiles for particular soil classes.\nE mapping exploration sites may have biased, opportunistic sample locations and moderate location precision, while R sites are more likely to have been predetermined by a model and located with high precision.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.6 Site selection method\nSpatial sampling strategies vary in their statistical properties. Soil data is stored for long periods and is often re-used for multiple projects; specific re-uses may not be appropriate.\nRecord the spatial sampling strategy used using the schema in Table 10.2. This parameter does not usually need to be recorded in the field.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.2: Spatial sampling strategies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\n\n\n\n\nA\nArbitrary/opportunistic\n\n\nD\nData-driven\n\n\nM\nModel-based\n\n\nR\nRandom\n\n\nT\nTransect\n\n\nG\nGrid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 10.5: About these categories\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between data-driven D and model-based M centres around replicability. Data-driven sites are nominated using a loose set of rules or principles (e.g. “visit the major landforms on this farm but don’t go too far off the tracks”) and may be subject to minor changes once the worker is on-ground. Model-based site choices formalise this process with reference to specific input datasets, and the worker is committed to sample at the exact point chosen. Model-based methods may include ‘backup points’ for where an intended location cannot be physically accessed, but these are also pre-determined. Importantly, model-based choices can be regenerated from the same inputs.\nArbitrary A points are not pre-determined at all; rather, they are chosen after the worker is on site, in response to direct observation of on-ground conditions. These are often practical and time-efficient but are also likely to over-sample the more easily accessible and/or interesting parts of the landscape, to the detriment of overall representativeness.\nRandom, transect and grid sampling R, T, G effectively ignore environmental parameters. This is useful when the spatial distribution of a parameter of interest is unknown or poorly understood.\nSome of these methods can be combined - for example, data-driven transect choices with randomised locations along each. In such cases, the ‘last choice’ should be recorded - in this case, R. The details of the full sampling strategy should be discussed in project metadata.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.7 Exposure type\nThe method by which the soil was exposed for observation affects which parameters can be recorded, or at least recorded reliably.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.3: Method of profile exposure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nP1\nQuick pit\nPit up to 0.5 m wide and generally no deeper than 1m\n\n\nP2\nFull pit\nPit or trench &gt; 1 m wide, exposing the complete profile to regolith or bedrock\n\n\nE\nExposure\nRoad cutting or similar, chipped back and cleaned\n\n\nC1\nSmall Core\nRelatively undisturbed soil core, &lt; 50 mm diameter\n\n\nC2\nLarge Core\nRelatively undisturbed soil core, ≥ 50 mm diameter\n\n\nA\nAuger\nHand or mechanical auger, including e.g. post hole diggers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA samples generally cannot be used to determine soil structure due to the degree of disturbance.\nCombined sampling is common in field mapping, e.g. small pit excavation to ~0.50-0.75 m and augering to a required depth in relatively well-understood landscapes. Record these as P1.\nGouge-style augers used in soft marine sediments may be included in C2 even though they commonly narrow to &lt; 50 mm at their maximum depth.\nC1 style samplers are common in paddock-scale monitoring and research, where they are used for rapid surface measurement. These are not generally suitable for mapping as they cannot sample below the topsoil.\n\n\n\n10.2.8 Depth of observation\nRecord the maximum depth of observation from the soil surface in whole centimetres (e.g. ‘100 cm’). This does not necessarily need to be recorded in the field as it can be determined from the lower depth of the last horizon in the profile description.\nA full profile description ideally extends to bedrock, but this may not always be accessible with the equipment and time available. The target depth of observation for most applications in New Zealand is 100 cm. Classification systems like the NZSC and LUC rely on ruling out certain soil features within that depth range, as well as positively identifying others.\nSee Section A.1 for information on appropriate excavation equipment.\n\n\n10.2.9 Stopping early\nWhen the target depth cannot be achieved, note the reason for stopping early using the codes in Table 10.4.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.4: Stoppage reason\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nB\nBedrock\nunderlying rock mass encountered, no more soil to describe\n\n\nR\nResistance\nsoil too difficult to extract with available equipment\n\n\nC\nCollapse\nexcavation unstable or unsafe due to wetness or loose particle packing\n\n\nI\nIdentified\nthe depth required to confirm a key parameter was reached\n\n\nO\nOther\ncircumstances unrelated to the soil itself caused early stoppage",

Ongoing or recent erosion and deposition events may be briefly noted or described in more detail.\nSlope is the inclination of the land surface relative to the horizontal plane. Slope steepness affects many soil processes, notably erosion, water run-off and infiltration behaviour.\nDirect measurements of slope should be taken over a minimum distance of 20 meters. Stand 10 m upslope from the point of observation and measure downhill. Record in units of degrees, with a maximum precision of 0.1 (e.g. 6°). Record ND if slope cannot be reliably determined. Record NR if no measurement was taken.\nPrecision needs will vary with slope and survey purpose; whole number degrees are sufficient on any slope over about 5 degrees, but finer gradations can be useful for flatter locations.

The cutoff slope value for flatness is not always provided in soil description standards (e.g. Schoeneberger et al. (2012)) and is not consistent when it is, e.g.\n\n0.58° (~1%) for level ground in Soil and Terrain (2023), p. 19\n2.86° (5%) in Hurst et al. (2022), p. 14\n\nThe slope measurement method in use can restrict the recordable limit of flat land. For instance, a hand-held clinometer may be difficult to use consistently and accurately at slopes of less than 3°, while survey-grade equipment (e.g. a tripod-mounted laser level) will have a higher accuracy. Slope calculated from a DEM also has inherent limitations. For example, a DEM with a cell size of 20 m and a vertical resolution of 0.5 m cannot discriminate slope increments of less than ~1.43° (\\(tan^{-1}(0.5/20)\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 11.2: Extracting slope from DEMs\n\n\n\n\n\nSlope data for a site can be extracted from a DEM, provided some conditions are met:\n\nCell size should be less than 10 m; larger cells systematically underestimate local slope\nDEM source should ideally be of type D for acceptable accuracy (see Section 3.1.3)\nExtract the median slope within a 20 m radius, not the single value directly under the recorded point\nReview and, if necessary, adjust slopes extracted from sites described on exposures. These may be overestimates (e.g. where a track cuts into a slope, the values upslope behind the site would better represent the landform). Similarly, sites close to landform or landscape boundaries may also need review.",

    "text": "12.1 The soil surface\nA soil horizon is a distinct layer within a soil profile. Horizons are distinguished by differences in texture, stoniness, structure, colour, consistence or other soil properties as described in the following section. Delineated horizons should ideally represent depth intervals over which important soil attributes change minimally. Conversely, the horizon boundaries should represent depth intervals over which there is a relatively high rate of change of important soil properties.\nNot all important soil properties change from one horizon to the next or at the same rate with depth. In some instances confident interpretation of the suitability of a soil for a particular end use may depend on the rate of change of a single property at a horizon boundary. For this reason the basis for separating the horizon may need to be explicitly stated, not just the traditional generalised estimate of the amount of overall change.\nThe soil surface has a slightly more restrictive definition than the land surface. The soil surface begins below the layer of fresh leaf litter or small living plants, but above organic soil materials such as peat. The mineral soil surface is further restricted, being the top of the first horizon dominated by mineral soil material. Horizon depths are defined only with reference to the soil surface overall - scrape back litter or grasses and measure from there.\ndraw this",

At least 5 measurements should contribute to such an assessment.\nMeasure boundaries to and from the midpoint of each horizon transition zone (see Section 12.5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant 12.1: Defining horizons on steep slopes\n\n\n\n\n\nOn steeper slopes, measuring horizons from vertical exposures can exaggerate horizon thicknesses, as the soil horizons mantle the landscape perpendicular to the sloping surface (Prietzel and Wiesmeier 2019). This starts to matter at slopes &gt; 25°, and progressively becomes more important - especially when calculating volumetric stocks of soil components. Figure 12.1 shows how a vertical 30-cm depth represents a progressively shallower ‘true depth’ as slope increases.\nTo adjust vertically measured horizon depths to correct for slope, apply the formula \\(depth * cos(slope)\\). Supply depth in cm and slope in radians. Slopes measured in degrees can be converted to radians using the formula \\((slope * pi) / 180\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1: Depth exaggeration by slope.",

Drop the spade blade with the soil, approximately 0.3 m onto a hard surface, e.g., the blade of another spade. Remove major roots that bind the mass together and again note the attributes of the newly produced solids. Note that this procedure will not necessarily disaggregate very moist or wet soils.\nFor smaller exposures (P1, C1, C2), remove a handful of soil from the extracted horizon and carefully disaggregate the soil mass to segregate all peds. Do not destroy peds to create fragments, or disaggregate existing apedal material. Note the attributes of the solids as instructed below. For smaller exposures, also use a spade to extract surface material so that at least the topmost horizon can be assessed in detail.\nAssessing structure is generally impossible for A augered profiles, as the extraction method destroys it. However, the surface horizon should still be extracted with a spade and assessed if possible.\n\n\n\n14.1.1 Pedality\nPedality refers to the degree of structural development evident within the horizon, independent of size or shape.

The appearance is as of breadcrumbs, with 0.5-2mm rounded peds loosely to firmly packed, depending on depth and drainage. Larger weak subangular blocky structures in well-drained allophanic soils almost always break down into moderately or strongly developed crumb structure.\nNut structure: a larger version of crumb, usually on the order of 5-20 mm in diameter, often encased in a network of grass roots. Nut structures are more common in topsoils but can also occur in well-drained loamy subsoils.\n\nBoth structures are more correctly described as spheroidal with a characteristic size range of 1 ± 0.5 mm for crumb and 15 ± 10 mm for nut. Their use as a shorthand description is convenient, but the terms should not be used in databases because they conflate size and shape in a way that the modern schemas seek to avoid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 14.3: : Artificially induced pedality shapes and identifying characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\nOrientation\n\n\n\n\nCL\nClod\nAn artificially induced soil aggregate ≥ 100 mm in length\nAny\n\n\nFM\nFragment\nAn artificially induced soil aggregate &lt; 100 mm in length\nAny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.1.3 Ped size\nRecord the median length of the peds observed, along their longest axis.

See Table 22.1 for a more detailed set of size classifications that may be applied to numeric size data.\n\n14.1.3.1 Nesting peds\nPeds are commonly nested, with large structures breaking down to smaller ones that may also be a different shape.

    "text": "16.1 Texture classes\nSoil texture refers to the behaviour of the fine-earth fraction when thoroughly reworked under moist conditions. Texture provides a field estimate of particle size distribution, which is determined in the laboratory. The two measurements are analogous but not identical.\nSoil texture is a rapid method that can suggest information about clay mineral type, angularity or roundedness in the sand and silt fractions, organic matter content, and the influence of secondary minerals, as well as the mineral particle size distribution itself. However, the method has precision limits and requires careful user calibration.\nLaboratory particle size measurement can involve measurements of particle shape and mineralogy but these methods are labour-intensive and generally confined to a research context. High-throughput analyses confine themselves to assessment of particle size alone, making assumptions about shape and mineralogy (see Loveland and Whalley (2001), for a more detailed discussion.)\nParticle size analysis usually involves removal of organic materials and soluble minerals as well as more aggressive aggregate dispersion using shaking and chemical solutions. Following dispersion, measurements of 3-8 specific size fractions are recorded. These data are then usually summarised into a three part sand/silt/clay composition and classified against a texture triangle for efficient communication.\nThe boundaries of these three size fractions are somewhat unsettled. The silt-clay boundary aligns with some major changes in particle properties; chief among them the emergence of electrostatic behaviour in the clay fraction. The sand/silt boundary can range from 0.02-0.063 µm. See Table 16.1 for the fractions used in NZ and other jurisdictions.\nSand/silt/clay compositional data can be displayed on a triangle plot (see Figure 16.1), and domains within the plot, or ‘texture classes’, are labelled for ease of communication. It is important to remember that these classes do not have sharp changes in hand-feel texture at their boundaries. A very large number of soil texture triangles have been defined in different jurisdictions.\nFigure 16.1: New Zealand Soil Texture Triangle\nTable 16.2: New Zealand Texture Triangle class names and compositional limits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nClay range\nSilt range\nSand range\n\n\n\n\nS\nSand\n&lt; 8%\n&lt; 20%\n≥ 80%\n\n\nLS\nLoamy Sand\n&lt; 8%\n≥ 12 - &lt; 40%\n≥ 52 - &lt; 80%\n\n\nSL\nSandy Loam\n≥ 8 - &lt; 18%\n0 - &lt; 40%\n≥ 42 - &lt; 92%\n\n\nLZ\nLoamy Silt\n&lt; 18%\n≥ 40 - &lt; 82%\n&lt; 60%\n\n\nZ\nSilt\n&lt; 18%\n≥ 82%\n&lt; 18%\n\n\nSC\nSandy Clay Loam\n≥ 18 - &lt; 35%\n&lt;15%\n≥ 50 - &lt; 82%\n\n\nCL\nClay Loam\n≥ 18 - &lt; 35%\n≥ 15 - &lt; 40%\n≥ 25 - &lt; 67%\n\n\nZL\nSilt Loam\n≥ 18 - &lt; 35%\n≥ 40 - &lt; 82%\n&lt; 42%\n\n\nLC\nLoamy Clay\n≥ 35 - &lt; 60%\n&lt; 30%\n≥ 10 - &lt; 65%\n\n\nZC\nSilty Clay\n≥ 35 - &lt; 60%\n≥ 30 - &lt; 65 %\n&lt; 35%\n\n\nC\nClay\n≥ 60%\n&lt; 40%\n&lt; 40%",

    "text": "17.3 Pans\nPans form when particular chemicals precipitate out of the soil solution and cement a layer of mineral particles (perhaps as a further accumulation and joining together of coatings and/or concentrations), or when particular particle size distributions and/or shape range become very tightly packed. Many pans are diagnostic in the NZSC.\nFor rapid assessment, record only the pan type using Table 17.4. It is assumed that pans recorded this way are strongly developed enough to be classification-relevant. Note also that many (but not all) pans have dedicated conventional horizon names, and in those cases the horizon names these can be used for rapid assessment instead.\nPans can be described in detail in terms of type, thickness, continuity, structure, strength and cementation. Pans comprise distinct horizons, so their thickness is defined using horizon boundaries. Their strength and cementation are assessed using Table 18.1 and Table 18.9. Codes for type, continuity and structure are given below.

    "text": "18.1 Preparing for consistence assessment\nConsistence is a general term for the field-assessed behaviour of soil materials in response to applied stress over a range of soil-water states from wet to dry. The consistence properties described are strength, failure, fluidity, penetration resistance, packing, sensitivity, induration, plasticity, stickiness, dilatancy, and dry coherence.\nConsistency tests should be performed down-profile, with at least one sample tested per horizon. Samples should be taken from the mid-point of each horizon. Additional samples in transition zones may also be of interest.\nThe nature of the soil materials in each horizon determines what tests can and should be done. The first step is to determine if the sample is cohesive.\nThe range of properties which can be described in gravelly, cohesive soils varies with gravel content. In practice, this depends on the feasibility of obtaining samples for the required tests.\nThe distinction between cohesive and non-cohesive is recognised by performing moulding, plasticity, and dilatancy tests in the following sequence (Figure 18.1). Where doubt still remains after these tests have been completed, the dry coherence test (Section 18.1.1) may be necessary.\nflowchart TD\n  q1[\"Can a sample cube be formed\\n from remoulded material?\"] --&gt;|yes| q2[Is the material plastic?]\n  q2 ----&gt;|yes| a1([\"**Cohesive**\"])\n  q1 --&gt;|no| q3[Is the material plastic?]\n  q3 --&gt;|yes| q4\n  q2 --&gt;|no| q4[\"Does the material have a\\n fast positive reaction to\\n the dilatency test?\"]\n  q4 --&gt;|no| q5[\"Does the material have a\\n distinctly negative reaction to\\n the dilatency test?\"]\n  q4 ---&gt;|yes| a2\n  q3 ----&gt;|no| a2([\"**Non-cohesive**\"])\n  q5 --&gt;|yes| a1\n  q5 --&gt;|no| a2\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.1: Determining sample cohesion",

    "text": "19.1 Field tests\nField tests support confident soil profile descriptions in the field by providing immediate indications of key soil chemical properties. As well as informing the description itself, the tests can help guide sampling decisions and later choice of laboratory analyses. In some cases, they can act as quality control measures (e.g. large inconsistencies in pH between field and laboratory may indicate unwanted sample oxidation in acid sulfate soils).\nField tests do have limited precision and accuracy vs their laboratory equivalents, due to their simplicity and short observation times. Where field tests are not conclusive, laboratory testing may still be warranted.\nField tests should be performed down-profile, with at least one sample tested per horizon. Samples should be taken from the mid-point of each horizon. Additional samples in transition zones may also be of interest. Properties within the upper part of the first B horizon can be diagnostic in soil classification.\nFor classifying using the NZSC, particular tests down to a certain depth may be required.

    "text": "Note 19.1: Field chemical tests and the New Zealand Soil Classification (NZSC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGley soils: Detectable ferrous ions (Fe2+) in the soil solution within the top 30 cm, signifying a reduced/anoxic environment (Section 19.1.8). A slaking test may be required to confirm absence of an underlying duripan (Section 19.1.10)\nUltic soils: pH below 5.5 anywhere between the base of the A horizon and 60 cm depth (Section 19.1.1 or Section 19.1.2)\nAllophanic soils: Strong pH response to sodium fluoride in at least 35 cm of the top 60 cm (Section 19.1.7)\nMelanic soils: Fine earth fraction reacts with 10% HCl, signifying carbonate presence (Section 19.1.5)\nSemiarid soils: pH of 7.5 or more within the top 90 cm (150 cm if sandy or skeletal) (Section 19.1.1 or Section 19.1.2)\nOxidic soils: No pH response to sodium fluoride within the diagnostic oxidic horizon(s) (Section 19.1.7)\nPallic soils: Where a calcareous horizon is part of the profile, confirmation of its presence with 10% HCl (Section 19.1.5)\nBrown soils: at least moderate pH response to sodium fluoride in the uppermost subhorizon of the B horizon. (Section 19.1.7)\n\npH, carbonate, allophane and salinity tests are also common diagnostics at the group and subgroup level.\n\n\n\n\n19.1.1 Colourimetric field pH (pHf)\nThis method, after Raupach and Tucker (1959), requires the use of a pre-made kit containing universal pH indicator, barium sulfate powder, and a calibrated colour card for interpreting results. These kits can be purchased at hardware or garden supply stores as well as specialist environmental field supply stores. The tests are simple but only precise to ± 0.5 units, and accurate (vs laboratory-based testing) to around the same degree. They are usually valid over pH range 2-10.\nEquipment\n\nField pH kit:\n\nuniversal indicator\nbarium sulfate powder\ncalibrated colour interpretation card\nsmall sample containers or plastic tray\nstirring stick\n\n\nProcedure\n\nWith clean hands or a small scoop, remove ~1-2 cm2 soil into a small container. Mix or crush the sample lightly to break open small peds.\nSprinkle the sample surface with just enough barium sulfate powder to cover. This is used to make it easier to see the pH indicator colour.\nAdd a couple of drops of pH indicator. Match the indicator colour to the card provided and record the pH of the closest match (e.g. 40 cm - 5.5). Do not interpolate between chips. Do not wait to read the pH - readings are unreliable after the sample has dried.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources of variation between pHf and laboratory pH\n\n\n\n\n\nSome variability between colorimetric field and electronic laboratory pH is expected. Reasons for the variability may include:\n\nThe quality of the reagents in use, the kit’s age and how carefully it has been stored. The dye recipe needs to have been followed accurately so that the resulting colours match the calibration card. Impurities in the supplied barium sulfate powder can also cause issues. The calibration card itself needs to be printed with accurate colours, waterproofed, and not left to bleach in the sun.\nOperators need full colour vision to interpret the card correctly. While diagnosed colour blindness is relatively rare, many people have minor colour-recognition limitations without knowing it. Taking a colour vision test periodically is recommended.\nSamples taken for laboratory analysis may react during transport, in storage or during sample processing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19.1.2 Field pH in water (pHfw)\npHfw is measured with a field-ready electronic pH meter. Electronic meters are precise and can measure the full 0-14 pH range, but are sensitive to temperature fluctuations and must be regularly calibrated. Always refer to the device manual for specific maintenance requirements.\nEquipment\n\nField-ready electronic pH meter (ideally with a temperature sensor)\nDeionised (DI) water or demineralised (DM) water\nSmall sample containers (e.g. 50 mL centrifuge tubes)\nStirring sticks\n\nProcedure\n\nWith clean hands or a small scoop, remove ~1-2 cm2 soil into a small container. Mix with DI or DM water to a loose paste, ensuring that the mix is deep enough for the pH probe to be adequately covered.\nInsert the pH probe into the sample and wait for the reading to stabilise to 1 decimal place (No change for 10 seconds). Do not stir the sample with the probe.\nRecord the reading and the depth it was taken from (e.g. 40 cm - 5.2).\nThoroughly rinse the probe before testing the next sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample handling\n\n\n\nMake sure to sample with clean hands; tests can be easily contaminated by residues. In particular, sunscreens will cause a falsely high pH reading.\n\n\n\n\n19.1.3 Field pH in hydrogen peroxide (pHfox)\nField pH in concentrated hydrogen peroxide (30% H2O2) is paired with field pH in water to diagnose the presence of FeS2 (iron sulfide, or pyrite) and thus the presence of acid sulfate soil materials. A significant drop in pHfox vs pHfw is considered diagnostic; see the discussion in Sullivan et al. (2018a), section A1.4.4 for further details.\nThe following method is reproduced from Sullivan et al. (2018a), section A1.4.3.\nEquipment\n\nField-ready electronic pH meter (ideally with a temperature sensor)\nConcentrated hydrogen peroxide (30% H2O2)\nDeionised (DI) water or demineralised (DM) water\nSmall sample containers (e.g. 50 mL centrifuge tubes) without lids.\nStirring sticks\n\nProcedure\n\nWith clean hands or a small scoop, remove ~1-2 cm2 soil into each tube.\nAdd enough H2O2 to cover each sample, and stir briefly. Do not cap and shake the tubes.\nAllow up to 15 minutes for any reaction to occur, especially in cool weather. Placing the rack in the sun may help progress the reaction. Note that strong reactions can sometimes occur almost instantly - observe the samples from a short distance and don’t peer into the tubes.\nWhere reactions occur, note their violence using the scale in Table 19.1. If excessive, the reaction may be tamped down by adding a very small amount of DI water.\nWhere reactions occur, wait for them to settle and add a little more H2O2. Repeat until the reaction no longer occurs.\nOnce reactions have fully completed and the tubes have cooled, measure the pH of each sample with the electronic meter. Record to the nearest 0.1 units as for pHfw, and rinse the probe thoroughly between readings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafe handling and preparation of hydrogen peroxide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcentrated hydrogen peroxide is highly corrosive. Wear safety glasses and gloves when handling, and in a field situation make sure that there is access to plenty of clean water for rinsing.\nBefore bringing H2O2 into the field, it must be buffered to pH 4.5-5.5. While stirring, add a few drops of dilute NaOH and regularly check the pH with a calibrated electrode until the correct range is reached. Allow the H2O2 to stand for 15 minutes and then recheck the pH.\nAs H2O2 degrades over time, only buffer small quantities at a time and refrigerate when not in use.\nIn the field, H2O2 containers should be kept out of direct sunlight and preferably in a small cooler, as excessive heat will cause the H2O2 to break down, releasing oxygen. This can cause its container to rupture or spit when opened. Only take small containers into the field, and monitor them for signs of elevated internal pressure (e.g. bulging). Make sure all containers are clearly labelled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 19.1: Hydrogen peroxide reaction strength ratings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nN\nNo reaction\nNo fizzing or bubbling after 15 minutes\n\n\nL\nSlight reaction\nSample fizzes or bubbles slightly but does not steam\n\n\nM\nModerate reaction\nSample bubbles and steams slightly but does not completely boil. Unlikely to continue reacting if more peroxide is added\n\n\nH\nHigh reaction\nSample boils and steams but does not boil over. May continue to react when more peroxide is added\n\n\nX\nExplosive reaction\nSample rapidly boils over and puts off considerable steam; likely to continue to react when more peroxide is added\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncubation methods for Acid Sulfate Soils\n\n\n\n\n\nField-adjacent incubation methods are available as an alternative low-cost method of identifying acid sulfate soils. These involve minimal equipment and no hazardous chemicals, but can take up to three months to complete. See (Sullivan et al. 2018b), Appendix C for further information.\n\n\n\n\n\n19.1.4 Electrical conductivity (ECf)\nThe soil solution’s ECf estimates its soluble salt content, which can affect plant nutrition and water uptake. Salinity is a diagnostic criteria in the NZSC, used within the Gley, Semi-Arid, Recent and Raw orders. In New Zealand, a 1:5 ratio of soil to water is used in the laboratory, and so this must be matched in the field.\nEquipment\n\nField-ready electrical conductivity meter (ideally with a temperature sensor)\nDeionised (DI) water or demineralised (DM) water\nSmall sample containers (e.g. 50 mL centrifuge tubes) with lids.\nStirring sticks\n\nProcedure\n\nWith clean hands or a small scoop, place soil in each tube up to the 5 mL mark. Top up with water to 30 mL.\nCap and shake each sample vigorously for 30s, then allow the samples to settle for a few minutes.\nUse the EC meter to record the solution conductivity. Report to the nearest 0.1 dS/m.\nRinse the probe thoroughly between measurements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConductivity units\n\n\n\n\n\nEC is most commonly reported in units of millisiemens/centimetre (mS/cm) or decisiemens per metre (dS/m), which are numerically equivalent. Other units less commonly used require specific conversion, e.g. electronic meters may report in µS/cm. 1 mS/cm = 1000 µS/cm.\n\n\n\n\n\n19.1.5 Calcium carbonate (Caf)\nWhile large chunks of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the form of shells or rock are easy to spot, CaCO3 in the fine earth is not, and there can also be some doubt about the composition of secondary features. This test should be considered for use when working in limestone-containing country, where field pH &gt; 7, or when white or pale concentrations or coatings are observed.\nCalcium carbonate reacts with acidic solutions in a neutralisation reaction, releasing water, carbon dioxide and heat as it becomes a salt. The reaction is rapid and causes a soil sample to ‘fizz’ visibly. 10% (or 1 M) HCl is used for this test as it is stable, cheap and relatively safe while still reacting vigorously.\nEquipment\n\n10% or 1M Hydrochloric acid, stored in a small dropper bottle\nsmall sample containers or plastic tray\n\nProcedure\n\nWith clean hands or a small scoop, remove ~1-2 cm2 soil into a small container. Lightly crush to break up peds and/or concentrations.\nUsing a dropper bottle, add a drop or two of HCl and observe closely.\nRecord the vigour of the reaction using Table 19.2.\n\nHCl can also be applied directly to a soil exposure, but be careful not to include the tested patches in any soil samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafe handling and preparation of HCl\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHCl is corrosive. Wear safety glasses and gloves when handling, and in a field situation make sure that there is access to plenty of clean water for rinsing.\nDon’t transport large quantities of HCl, even dilute. A 25-50 mL bottle will normally last for weeks of fieldwork.\nMake sure HCl containers are clearly labelled. For dropper bottles with soft plastic or rubber lids, monitor for degradation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 19.2: Hydrochloric acid reaction ratings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nN\nNo reaction\nNo audible or visible fizzing\n\n\nL\nSlight reaction\nFizzing faintly audible and barely visible\n\n\nM\nModerate reaction\nFizzing audible and clearly visible, small bubbles ≤ 3 mm diameter\n\n\nH\nHigh reaction\nFizzing easily audible and visible, bubbles up to 7 mm diameter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring CaCO3\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Milne et al. (1995) and some other publications (Kalra and Maynard 1991; Rayment and Lyons 2011) have attempted to use the degree of fizzing to estimate CaCO3 % content, the estimates and descriptions of fizzing vary and are not considered highly reliable. If a precise numeric estimate of CaCO3 % is required, it should be measured under laboratory conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n19.1.6 Manganese (Mnf)\nManganese concentrations in soil are dark and often very small, so may be missed or mistaken for other minerals. Manganese oxides react to H2O2 in a similar fashion to iron sulfide (see Section 19.1.3). This test uses a safer dilute H2O2 solution. This test should be considered for use where dark flecks are observed in the soil profile, particularly under imperfect to poor drainage conditions (see Section 22.3).\nEquipment\n\nDilute (3-6%) H2O2 solution, stored in a small dropper bottle\nSmall sample containers or plastic tray\n\nProcedure\n\nWith clean hands or a small scoop, remove ~1-2 cm2 soil into a small container. Lightly crush to break up peds and/or concentrations.\nUsing a dropper bottle, add a drop or two of dilute H2O2 and observe closely for fizzing.\nRecord the presence or absence of a reaction (e.g. 40 cm - ✔).\n\nDilute H2O2 can also be applied directly to a soil exposure, but be careful not to include the tested patches in any soil samples. Note that H2O2 will also react with organic material, so this test is not definitive in highly organic samples. Using concentrated H2O2 will increase the likelihood of misinterpretation as it will attack organic material more vigorously.\n\n\n19.1.7 Reactive aluminium (NaFf)\nThis test indicates the presence of reactive hydroxy-aluminium sites on soil minerals. In New Zealand, these sites are most often associated with the presence of the minerals allophane and imogolite. Reactive hydroxy-aluminium sites can also be found on ferrihydrite and aluminium-humus complexes, especially in podzolic B horizons. The principle of the method is that fluoride ions at about pH 7 react with hydroxy-aluminium to release hydroxyl ions, causing a rise in pH. The test conditions have been chosen so that the released OH- from soils containing reactive hydroxy-aluminium turn phenolphthalein indicator reagent red (pH &gt; 9) whilst most other soils remain at lower pH values so that the indicator remains colourless.\nEquipment\n\nSaturated aqueous NaF solution (1 M NaF, maintained in the presence of an excess of undissolved NaF)\nFilter paper (Whatman No. 42 or similar) treated with phenolphthalein indicator (0.5% dissolved in 50% ethanol) and subsequently dried.\n\nProcedure\n\nWith clean hands or a small scoop, place ~0.5 cm2 soil on a piece of pre-treated filter paper. Lightly crush to break up peds and put the soil in firm contact with the paper.\nUsing a dropper bottle, add a drop or two of 1 M NaF (enough to wet the sample but not flood it) and wait up to 2 minutes.\nRecord the reaction intensity using Table 19.3 (e.g. 40 cm - M).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafe handling and preparation of NaF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaF is toxic. Wear safety glasses and gloves when handling, and in a field situation make sure that there is access to plenty of clean water for rinsing.\nMake sure NaF containers are clearly labelled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 19.3: Sodium fluoride reaction ratings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\nColour\n\n\n\n\nN\nNo reaction\nNo colour change\n\n\n\nCircle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL\nSlight reaction\nPaper turns faint pink within two minutes\n\n\n\nCircle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\nModerate reaction\nPaper turns moderate pink, usually within 30 seconds\n\n\n\nCircle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH\nStrong reaction\nPaper turns dark pink, usually instantly\n\n\n\nCircle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse caution interpreting the NaFf test\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe presence of alkaline conditions and/or free calcium carbonate will cause a strong false positive for this test, as the NaF will precipitate to CaF2 and yield Na2CO3. When in doubt, pre-screening with 10% HCl or a field pH test is recommended to avoid confusion.\nThe presence of organic matter can interfere with the test by buffering the pH change.\nSoils containing free aluminium (Al2+) may also react.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaFf test interpretation\n\n\n\n\n\nScales used to interpret the NaFf test have been inconsistently presented over the decades since its original publication, with a tendency to get more complicated over time. The scale presented in Table 19.3 is a return towards the simpler schemas seen in early reporting.\nWhile a correlation can be made between P-retention and NaF reaction intensity within younger volcanic soils (Allophanic and Pumice soil orders) the correlation does not hold across all soils.\n\n\n\n\n\n19.1.8 Reducing conditions\nReducing conditions can be suggested by low-chroma soil colours, redox mottling and other indicators of poor drainage. More confident diagnoses can be made by including field testing for reduced iron (Fe2+) as an indicator of persistently reducing conditions. Rapid testing for Fe2+ can be accomplished using 2,2’-Bipyridine (previously/also known as ⍺-⍺-dipyridyl) dye, which turns pinkish red in the presence of Fe2+. Test strips are also commercially available and may prove easier to use in the field (Berkowitz et al. 2017). Note that these tests should only be conducted on wet or moist soils; soils that are in a slightly moist to dry state will not be experiencing reducing conditions.\nProcedure\n\nWith clean hands or a small scoop, remove ~1-2 cm2 soil into a small container or a surface with a white background.\nDepending on method:\n\nIf using indicator strips, press the strip gently against the sample surface for a few seconds, then remove and check for colour change.\nIf using 2,2’-Bipyridine dye, apply a few drops to the sample and watch for a colour change.\n\nRecord the presence or absence of a reaction (e.g. 40 cm - ✔).\n\nIn both cases work quickly, as if reduced, the sample will oxidise rapidly on excavation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafe handling of 2,2’-Bipyridine solution\n\n\n\n\n\nSome manuals have suggested the use of a spray bottle to apply 2,2’-Bipyridine to an exposure or extracted sample. This is not recommended due to the chemical’s toxicity. See (National Center for Biotechnology Information 2024) for further details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther methods of assessing reduction\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent best practice for research-grade monitoring of redox potential in soils involves the use of IRIS indicator devices (Sapkota et al. 2022), sometimes in concert with electronic sensors. IRIS devices require specialist construction, installation for several weeks and careful post-processing.\n\n\n\n\n\n19.1.9 Water repellence\nWater repellence in soils results from hydrophobic organic compounds (e.g. plant leaf waxes) accumulating under a specific range of soil moisture conditions (Dekker et al. 2009). Repellency is thus locally and seasonally variable, and usually confined to surface layers. Water repellence is most commonly assessed under field conditions using distilled water.\nEquipment\n\nDeionised (DI) or demineralised (DM) water, stored in a small dropper bottle\nSmall sample containers or plastic tray\n\nProcedure\n\nWith clean hands or a small scoop, remove ~1-2 cm2 soil into a small container. Leave the sample intact.\nUse a dropper to place a single drop of distilled water onto the soil surface. Measure how long it takes for the drop to be absorbed.\nIf the drop takes longer than 5 seconds to disappear, record a positive result (e.g. 40 cm - ✔).\n\n\n\n19.1.10 Rapid slaking and dispersion\nSoil aggregates can slake, or disintegrate, when wet up from a dry state, as trapped air rushes out of pore spaces. Over a longer time period, clay swelling may also contribute to aggregate breakdown by slaking. Aggregate resistance to slaking behaviour is modified by organic matter content and clay mineral type. Dispersive behaviour also causes aggregate breakdown in water but is driven by relative dominance of Na+ ions (and to some extent Mn2+ and K+) on ion exchange sites.\nField testing can reveal soils that are prone to rapid slaking and dispersion. However, soils that are only slightly prone to these behaviours may not be detected in the short assessment time described below. The test also requires dry soil samples, which can be hard to come by under New Zealand field conditions. Running the test over a 2 hour period on air-dried peds after fieldwork will often be more useful. The laboratory equivalent assessment runs over a minimum of 20 hours (Emerson 2002; Standards Australia).\nEquipment\n\nDeionised (DI) or demineralised (DM) water\nShallow dish, 3-5 cm deep and 15-30 cm in diameter\n\nProcedure\n\nSet out a testing dish in a sheltered location and fill with at least 2-3 cm of DI or DM water (enough to completely cover added peds). Allow to settle.\nCarefully add one or two dry peds from each massive or pedal soil horizon, working clockwise around the dish. Minimise disturbing the water.\nObserve the samples after waiting 10 minutes. Rate their slaking behaviour using Table 19.4. Rate their dispersive behaviour using Table 19.5.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 19.4: Slaking behaviour ratings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nN\nNo slaking\nPeds remain intact.

Horizons are given a particular designation according to their position in the profile and according to soil properties that reflect the kind and degree of pedogenic alteration. As designations are made in the field, they are defined mainly by morphological properties that differentiate horizons from those above or below, or from a presumed parent material. Laboratory data may be needed to confirm identification, especially in marginal cases. This scheme was developed from the system used in England and Wales (Avery 1980) by Clayden and Hewitt (2015), and is broadly similar to those used overseas (e.g. WRB (2022)). However, note that significant differences in suffix use exist between all of these systems as they have become adapted to regional conditions.",

It is saturated with water for at least 30 consecutive days in most years, or has been artificially drained.\n\n\nA\nSurface\nMineral horizon formed at the surface, or below an organic horizon. It is characterised by incorporation of humified organic matter, or properties resulting from disturbance by cultivation. The organic matter has been incorporated by biological activity or by mixing through cultivation rather than by translocation.\n\n\nE\nEluviated\n\n\nSubsurface mineral horizon that contains less organic matter and/or iron and/or clay than the horizon immediately below, as a result of downward or lateral movement.\n\nIt is identified by having all of the following:\n\nA moist colour value of 4 or more, or a dry colour value of 5 or more, with or without silty or sandy coatings (skeletans, @brewer1964), observable in a dry specimen.\nHigher colour value or lower chroma and less well developed pedality than an underlying B horizon.\nLess organic matter and higher colour value than an overlying H, O or A horizon.\n\nThe colour of the horizon can be that of uncoated sand and silt grains but E horizons are also recognised where coats of iron oxides or other minerals mask the colour of the primary particles.\n\n\nB\nSubsoil\n\n\nSubsurface mineral horizon without rock structure (including fine stratification in soft sediments), characterised by one or more of the following:\n\n\nIlluvial concentration of silicate clay, iron, aluminium or organic matter, alone or in some combination.\nCoatings of sesquioxides that give the horizon a lower colour value, a higher chroma, or redder hue than the horizons above and below, without apparent illuviation of iron.\nAlteration that has formed silicate clay or liberated oxides or both, and that leads to ped formation.\nEvidence of solution and removal of carbonates.\n\nA B horizon is differentiated from adjacent horizons by moist and dry colour and/or pedality and normally underlies an A or E horizon.\n\n\nC\nRegolith\n\n\nUnconsolidated or weakly consolidated mineral horizon that is little affected by pedogenic processes and lacks properties of A, E or B horizons.

It may contain material from pre-existing E, B or C horizons.\n\n\nApp\nRecently tilled\nAn Ap horizon consisting mainly of clods and fragments with little pedal material, caused by cultivation during the past year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the g suffix wherever the A horizon has ≥ 2% redox segregations.\nNote: As A horizons are expected to generally be dark and/or low-chroma from elevated organic matter, the other redox modifiers available in deeper horizons may not be applied.\n\n\n\n21.1.2.3 E horizons\n\n\n\n\nTable 21.4: Secondary E horizon divisions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nEa\nLeached\nNo redox segregations; grains largely uncoated. Can be very pale if quartz-dominated. Rarely saturated, usually overlies Bh or Bs.\n\n\nEw\nWeathered\n\n\nBoth of the following:\n\n\na moist chroma of 4 or more but less than 6, and\n&lt; 2% redox segregations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.1.2.4 B Horizons\n\n\n\n\nTable 21.5: Secondary B horizon divisions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nBfm\nPlacic\n\n\nSharply defined, cemented, pan-like B horizon usually less then 10 mm thick but the same designation is given to horizons up to 25 mm thick. It is black to reddish brown or dark red in colour, and a black upper part can often be distinguished from a reddish brown lower part. It lies roughly parallel to the soil surface but is commonly wavy or convolute. A Bfm horizon usually occurs as a single pan but in places it can be bifurcated. It forms a barrier to most roots and restricts water movement.\n\nThe Bfm horizon is equivalent to the concept of the placic horizon (Soil Survey Staff 1975) except that New Zealand ironpans are enriched in iron and organic matter without significant accumulations of manganese [@clayden1990].\n\n\nBw\nWeathered\n\n\nBoth of the following:\n\n\na moist chroma of 4 or more but less than 6, and\n&lt; 2% redox segregations.\n\n\n\n\nBh\nHumose\n\n\nDark-coloured B horizon of podzolised soils enriched in organic matter, associated with aluminium, or iron and aluminium, as a result of illuviation.\n\nIt has a moist value and chroma of 3 or less, or a value of 4 if chroma is 2, dominant in the matrix, and contains 1% or more organic carbon. The fabric has sand- or silt- size pellet-like aggregates, coats on mineral grains, or both. In some horizons (including humus-pans, Bhm), coatings have coalesced to fill pores and cement the horizon.\n\n\nBo\nOchreous\n\n\nA strongly weathered B horizon formed in mixed crystalline iron and aluminium oxides and kaolin minerals, with low activity clay properties. It must meet all the following requirements:\n\n\nWeak primary ped and soil strength at moist to dry soil water states.\nUnconfined failure is friable or very friable over very moist to dry soil water states. Materials fail to predominantly 3 mm or smaller microaggregates comprising silt- and sand-sized polyhedra and spheroids.\nPrimary peds slake rapidly in water to stable microaggregates which show no or slight dispersion after 100 inversions using the method of [@mcqueen1981].\nNegative reaction to the sodium fluoride test [@fieldes1966].\n\nBo horizons are clayey with measured clay contents commonly exceeding 60%. Measured clay % is usually larger than in overlying A horizons, but clay increase is not a defining criterion due to the difficulties of clay measurement in materials that are frequently difficult to disperse. Materials are only slightly sticky and plastic in relation to clay content. Clay coatings are either absent or only present at frequencies of about 1%. The Bo horizon has low activity clay accessory properties with ECEC and CEC less than 12 and 16 me.100 g clay respectively.\n\n\nBs\nSesquioxides\n\n\nOchreous B horizon of podzolised soils containing illuvial aluminium, iron, or both, that is closely associated, or complexed, with illuvial organic matter. The aluminium and iron is apparently mainly present as minerals with short-range order (especially allophane and ferrihydrite), though some aluminium is often present as aluminium-humus.\n\nThe designation Bs should be used for B horizons that:\n\noccur below an Ea, Bh, Bfm or a strongly acid A horizon, and\nhave a moist value and chroma both of more than 3, and\nhave a rapid positive reaction to the sodium fluoride test.\n\nIt is not possible to define the morphology of a Bs horizon such that it can be distinguished from certain Bw horizons enriched in iron and aluminium due to weathering in situ.\nCharacteristic features of Bs horizons are:\n\nReddest hue and highest chroma at the top of the horizon.\nEarthy apedal fabric with fine spheroids, or weakly developed blocks or polyhedrons.\nVery weak or moderately weak soil strength when moist or dry.\nA greasy or smeary feel when very moist.\nLow plasticity in relation to clay content.\nSand- or silt-size pellet-like aggregates, sesquioxidic coats on mineral grains or both.\n\n\n\n\nBt\nTranslocated\n\n\nB horizon containing translocated clay. It is required to have\n\n\nclay coatings that have a waxy lustre when dry and/or sufficient thickness to envelop fine sand grains, on ped faces or in pores, lamellae, or forming bridges between mineral grains, or\nif there is an overlying E or AE horizon with no lithological discontinuity at its base, sufficiently more clay than the eluvial horizon to be detectable by hand texturing (i.e. 5% more clay).\n\n\n\n\nBw\nWeathered\n\n\nB horizon that shows evidence of alteration under well aerated conditions and does not qualify as Bh, Bs or Bt.\n\nTo qualify as a Bw rather than BC or C it must meet at least one of the following requirements:\n\nRedder hue or higher chroma than an underlying horizon in similar materials (‘colour B’).\nHave spheroids, blocks, polyhedrons, tablets, prisms, columns or plates which distinguish the horizon from a BC or C horizon below (‘structural B’).\nEvidence of either partial or complete decalcification, i.e. less CaCO3 than the underlying horizon which may contain redeposited carbonates.\n\nA Bw horizon has less than 2% redox segregations. It is otherwise distinguished by the following colour requirements:\n\nWith moist values less than 5, chromas must be 3 or more.\nWith moist values 5 or more, chromas must be 4 or more.\n\n\n\n\nBC\nB-ish\nA horizon transitional in character between a B and a C horizon, usually below a B horizon. It is distinguished from a B horizon in similar material by lacking some required characteristic of colour, pedality or degree of weathering. It differs from a C horizon by having some B horizon feature, albeit weakly expressed. The same designation is also applied to morphologically similar subsurface horizons in profiles without a B horizon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.1.2.5 C Horizons\n\n\n\n\nTable 21.6: Secondary C horizon divisions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCR\nConsolidated\nA weakly consolidated C horizon that is sufficiently dense and coherent to form a significant barrier to roots. Soft rocks (with a hardness on Moh's scale of &lt; 3) such as shale and siltstone, and some exceptionally dense glacial tills are included. The material can be dug with difficulty with a spade when moist. The concept of the CR horizon is similar to that of the material underlying a paralithic contact, but without the restrictive requirement for the spacing of cracks.\n\n\nCu\nUnconsolidated\nUnconsolidated C horizon without evidence of strong gleying, accumulation of carbonates or more soluble salts. It is normally apedal, may show stratification and has less than 2% redox segregations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.1.2.6 R Horizons\n\n\n\n\nTable 21.7: Secondary R horizon divisions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nR\nRock\nHard or very hard bedrock that is impracticable to dig with a spade. The rock may contain cracks, but these are generally too few and too small for significant root development. However, trees and shrubs do root into fissures in R horizons and the definition is intended to be broader than the specifications for rock material below a lithic contact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.1.2.7 Transitional Horizons\nApart from the BC and CR described above, Two main kinds of transitional horizons are distinguished by specific conventions.\n\nTransitional horizons having properties of two master horizons as in gradational horizons in vertical sequence, e.g. Ap, AB, Bw. In other cases a horizon can be designated as transitional even if one of the master horizons to which it is apparently transitional is not present. For example, an AB horizon can be recognised where the underlying layer is bedrock (R), and a BC horizon can be recognised even if no underlying C horizon is identified.  Lower case suffixes are used following the two capital letters where the property denoted by the suffix applies to the whole horizon, e.g., ABg, BCt, BCx.\nTransitional horizons in which discrete parts have recognisable properties of two kinds of master horizon, e.g., where pieces of A horizon are incorporated in a B horizon or where horizons interfinger. In this case the horizon is designated by two capital letters separated by a solidus, e.g. B/C. Appropriate suffixes should be used where the components of the material are clearly identifiable, e.g. Ap/Bw.\n\nFor simplicity the capital letters for all transitional horizons are used in the order A, E, B, C irrespective of which properties dominate. For example, all horizons transitional between A and B horizons are designated AB or A/B, with suffixes as appropriate.\n\n\n\n21.1.3 Redox suffixes\nThe following suffixes can be added to most E, B, or C horizons to signify the degree to which they have been affected by water saturation and reducing conditions, e.g. Bg. Some exceptions exist:\n\ng and r suffixes cannot be used with Ew or Bw horizons, which are defined by their development under well-aerated conditions.\ng and r suffixes cannot be used with Cu, as it is partly defined by a lack of strong gleying.\n\nPer below, low-chroma colours have:\n\nmoist chroma of 2 or less, or\nmoist chroma of 3 with values of 6 or more.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 21.8: Redox suffixes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nno code\nUnaffected\n&lt; 2% redox segregations, no low-chroma colours\n\n\n(f)\nSlightly reduced\n≥ 2% redox segregations, no low-chroma colours\n\n\n(g)\nReduced\n≥ 2% redox segregations, matrix and/or ped faces have &lt; 50% low-chroma colours\n\n\ng\nVery reduced\n≥ 2% redox segregations, matrix has 50-85% low chroma colours, and/or ped faces have &gt; 50% low-chroma colours\n\n\nr\nCompletely reduced\nMatrix has &gt; 85% low-chroma colours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.1.4 Other suffixes\nOne or more of these suffixes may be added to the designations defined above to provide more specific information about a horizon. For example, a Bg horizon containing more than 5% by volume of concretions is designated Bgc.\n\n\n\n\nTable 21.9: Other suffixes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nc\nConcretionary\n&gt; 5% by volume of concretions. May be combined with j, k, l, y, or z to further define the nature of the concretions.\n\n\nd\nDensipan\n\n\nTo denote an E horizon with densipan properties, usually Erd.\n\n\nEither unconfined strength as measured by a resistance to crushing test is hard or very hard at soil water states from near wet to dry, or soil penetration resistance measured by a 6.5 mm flat-tipped penetrometer exceeds 4000 kPa at soil water states from near wet to dry, and\nMoist and dry samples slake in water.\n\n\n\n\ne\nUnripe\nTo denote an unripe horizon, distinguished by having a moderately fluid or very fluid fluidity class.\n\n\n(h)\nCutanic\n\n\nTo denote a horizon with cutanic horizon properties. It has dark coloured coats on ped faces, in pores and on rock fragments. The coats have a moist value of 4 or less, or value 5 and chroma 3, and are assumed to be a complex of organic matter with clay and/or sesquioxides. Similar features are described as organic coatings by @bullock1985 and as “organans” by @brewer1964.\n\nIn coarse textured, apedal horizons, the translocated material can penetrate the matrix to the extent that patches of the whole horizon have the colour given above. In such cases the horizon can only be distinguished from a Bh of a podzolised soil by its relationship to adjacent horizons, or by a negative reaction to the sodium fluoride test, except for soil in volcaniclastic materials.\nThe suffix is used with Bs, Bt, Bw and BC horizons and also with Ea, Eg and Er horizons below hurnose or peaty surface layers.\n\n\ni\nNodular\nTo denote that the horizon contains more than 15% by volume of nodules, subrounded or irregular segregations of iron or aluminium oxyhydroxides with some kaolin.\n\n\nj\nJarositic\nTo denote the presence of straw-coloured jarosite, most commonly in g or r horizons.\n\n\nk\nCalcareous\nTo denote an accumulation of secondary carbonate, CaCO3.\n\n\nl\nGibbsitic\nTo denote an accumulation of gibbsite, Al(OH)3.\n\n\nm\nCemented\nTo denote a continuously cemented horizon that is strong enough to resist root penetration.\n\n\nn\nSodic\nTo denote an accumulation of sodium (identified in the field).\n\n\nq\nSilicic\nTo denote an accumulation of secondary silica. A duripan is designated q.\n\n\nv\nVariegated\nTo denote a horizon with mottles or variegated colour pattern due to differential weathering of mineral components and not attributable to reduction and segregation of iron caused by saturation with water.\n\n\nx\nFragic\n\n\nTo denote a horizon with fragipan properties, usually BCxg, BCx(g) or BCx.\n\nA fragipan must fulfill all of the following requirements:\n\nAn air-dried clod slakes when fully immersed in water.\nIt has brittle failure when moist. The horizon may contain rock fragments, but the fine earth must be sufficiently coherent to allow brittle fracture.\nIt has at least slightly firm moist soil strength.\nEither a. Extremely coarse or gross prismatic peds: the prisms have apedal-massive interiors, or break to secondary peds with horizontal dimensions of 100 mm or more, and the prism faces are defined by colours of chroma 3 or less, or b. The horizon is apedal-massive throughout, or has extremely coarse or gross prismatic peds, and the moist soil strength is very firm.\nIf roots are present, they are confined predominantly to planar voids between prisms or to worm galleries.\nMoist penetration resistance measured by a 6.5 mm flat-tipped penetrometer is 3100 kPa or more.\nIt does not occur within an E horizon.\n\nA fragipan usually has clay coatings on fissures or in pores between fissures. Their presence is not indicated by an additional suffix t. Likewise, the use of the additional suffix p with *g or *(g) to denote perched water is superfluous.\n\n\n(x)\nAlmost fragic\nTo denote a brittle horizon that does not meet all the requirements of a fragipan, e.g. Bw(x).\n\n\ny\nGypsic\nTo denote an accumulation of gypsum, CaSO4.\n\n\nz\nSalty\nTo denote an accumulation of salts more soluble than gypsum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.1.5 Lithological discontinuities\nNumbers 1-N may be used to signify lithological discontinuities, where the parent material changes significantly between layers e.g. 2C. Such discontinuities are identified by a significant difference between adjacent horizons, in the particle-size distribution of fractions coarser than 2 µm or in mineralogy, that cannot be attributed to pedogenic processes and/or by significant differences in age.\nThe main purpose of recognising lithological differences is to draw attention to inherited layering that can significantly influence physical properties, particularly permeability. Horizons comprising the uppermost parent material layer are not specifically designated, the prefix 1 being understood. Those comprising succeeding layers are numbered 2, 3, etc. consecutively with depth. When the material below horizon 2 is similar to the material above horizon 2, it is still given the label 3. Where two or more consecutive horizons have formed in the same kind of material, the same prefix number is applied to all the horizons in the material, eg. Ap, Ew, Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2BC.\n\n\n21.1.6 Numbering identical horizons\nIf a horizon needs be subdivided, append a number onto the end of the name. The horizon names must otherwise be identical, e.g. Bt1, Bt2, Btg1, Btg2 is correct, but Bt1, Bt2, Btg3, Btg4 is not. This convention can, however, cross lithological discontinuities, e.g. Bw1, Bw2, 2Bw3, 2Bw4.\n\n\n21.1.7 Buried horizons\nPedogenic horizons that have been buried by deposition of additional material and little modified subsequently are called buried horizons and denoted by the prefix ‘b’. A buried horizon is obviously not in the same deposit as overlying horizons. Some buried horizons, however, are formed in material that is lithologically similar to the overlying deposit. The symbol is not used in Organic Soils or to separate an organic layer from a mineral layer.\nThe notation for a buried Ah horizon in material similar to the overlying deposit is bAh, and that for a buried Ah horizon in dissimilar material is 2bAh.The horizons of a sequence of buried soils are given consecutive numbers for each soil following the prefix b, independently of the numbers for litholgical discontinuities that are placed before the b.",

Assign one of the classes in Table 21.17 to each horizon. Note that ‘xs’ represents effective impermeability. The classes have been slightly simplified from those in Griffiths (1991) and Griffiths et al (1999).\nPermeability is very difficult to assess in the field, but considerable work has been done to associate particular ranges of values with the components of the functional horizon. As such, each functional horizon has a default permeability class and usually one or more additional allowable classes. Use the functional horizon name to narrow down the appropriate choice of permeability rating, per Table 21.18 below.\n\n\n\n\nTable 21.17: Horizon-level permeability classes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nxs\nExtremely slow\n&lt; 0.1 mm/h\n\n\ns\nSlow\n0.1 - 4 mm/h\n\n\nms\nModerately slow\n4 - 18 mm/h\n\n\nm\nModerate\n18 - 72 mm/h\n\n\nr\nRapid\n&gt; 72 mm/h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.2.2 Functional horizon names\nValid combinations of the above components are listed below, along with associated permeability classes.\n\nThe t prefix can be added to any of these.\nThe z or b prefix can be added to any of these, except for Oh, Or, J, and Q.\nA good reason is needed to deviate from the default permeability (e.g. an Lw with r permeability would need a low clay content).\n\n\n\n\nTable 21.18: Functional horizon names and allowed permeability classes.

    "text": "22.3 Horizon drainage\nSoil drainage is an assessment of how fast water leaves a soil profile relative to supply. This characteristic can be controlled by morphological characteristics that occur in a range of combinations.\nDrainage should first be assessed on a per-horizon basis.

Table 22.5 below highlights the common characteristics associated with each horizon drainage class.\n\n\n\n\nTable 22.5: Horizon-level drainage characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nHorizon Names\nTypical Moisture\nMain colours\nRedox concentrations\n\n\n\n\nVP\nVery poor\nO*, *r\nSaturated or wet\nLow-chroma\nFew to none\n\n\nPO\nPoor\n*r, *g\nWet\nLow-chroma\nFew to none, mottles more often on ped surfaces than internals\n\n\nIP\nImperfect\n*(g)\nWet to Moist\nLow-chroma patterns on brighter matrix\nFe and/or Mn-rich segregations, nodules and pans\n\n\nMW\nModerately Well\n*(f)\nWet to Dry\nColour patterns but no low chroma colours\nMottles more often in ped interiors\n\n\nWE\nWell\nNo redox suffixes\nMoist to Dry\nNo low chroma colours\nFew to none\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.3.1 Classifying topsoil drainage\nMorphological features associated with drainage status can be hard to spot in A horizons, mostly due to their darker colour. When otherwise in doubt, a well developed A horizon should be assigned a drainage class one better than the horizon below it (usually a B, E, or C horizon). A poorly developed A horizon should receive the same class assignment as the horizon below. Use the ‘distinct topsoil’ NZSC diagnostic criteria to identify well developed A horizons.\nThe reasoning behind this rule of thumb is that the lack of topsoil development may be partially explained by lack of contrast in the drainage regime between the topsoil and the layer below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoils that are persistently wet may also become anoxic. This is more common in low-permeability soils, where slow percolation allows enough time for oxygen to be consumed entirely.",

    "text": "23.1.1 LUC Slope\nThe most commonly-used slope classification in New Zealand is the one associated with the Land Use Capability (LUC) framework. These classes were formulated primarily to support pastoral agriculture, and the class boundaries focus on slope as an activity limiter, rather than an inherent landscape property. This means that the classification can potentially underperform in landscapes where natural slopes are close to the class boundaries. This is acknowledged in the LUC Handbook (Lynn et al. 2009) by the inclusion of various options for modifying slope class.\nThe class boundaries are reproduced from Table 26 of the LUC Handbook in Table 23.1. Some generalised groupings are also included - these are discussed in Appendix 1 of the LUC Handbook but are not explicitly defined.\n\n\n\n\nTable 23.1: LUC Slope Classes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nSlope angle (degrees)\n\n\n\n\nWheelable\n\n\nA\n0 - 3\n\n\nB\n4 - 7\n\n\nC\n8 - 15\n\n\nHilly\n\n\nD\n16 - 20\n\n\nE\n21 - 25\n\n\nSteep\n\n\nF\n26 - 35\n\n\nG\n&gt; 35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the Handbook does not provide fully closed limits for slope classes. For consistency, class A should be considered to be 0 - ≤4, B as &gt;4 - ≤8, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n23.1.2 Natural Log classifications\nWork by Speight (Speight 1971) promotes the use of slope classes with natural-log derived limits on the basis that they come closest to a universal set of ‘characteristic slopes’. The limits proposed are shown in Table 23.2. These classes are commonly used in Australian soil survey, and focus more on splitting up low-slope areas of the landscape. As such, these may be more useful for interpreting low-relief landscapes than the LUC classes.\n\n\n\n\nTable 23.2: Natural-log Slope Classes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nSlope angle (percent)\nSlope angle (degrees)\n\n\n\n\nLE\nLevel\n0 - ≤ 1\n0 - ≤ 0.57\n\n\nVG\nVery Gentle\n&gt; 1 - ≤ 3\n&gt; 0.57 - ≤ 1.72\n\n\nGE\nGentle\n&gt; 3 - ≤ 10\n&gt; 1.72 - ≤ 5.71\n\n\nMO\nModerate\n&gt; 10 - ≤ 32\n&gt; 5.71 - ≤ 17.7\n\n\nST\nSteep\n&gt; 32 - ≤ 56\n&gt; 17.7 - ≤ 29.25\n\n\nVS\nVery Steep\n&gt; 56 - ≤ 100\n&gt; 29.25 - ≤ 45\n\n\nPR\nPrecipitous\n&gt; 100 - ≤ 300\n&gt; 45 - ≤ 71.6\n\n\nCL\nCliffed\n&gt; 300\n&gt; 71.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Soil and Land Survey Field Handbook (Soil and Terrain 2023) notes that in certain circumstances it may be useful to split the classes VG, GE and MO, at 1.8% (1.0°), 5.6% (3.2°), and 18% (10.2°) respectively. The document does not, however, elucidate those circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\n23.1.3 UN-FAO Classification\nThe following classification was offered by the UN-FAO Guidelines for Soil Description (UN-FAO 2006). The classes are highly discriminatory on low slopes, but lump most steeper slopes into only two categories.

This cannot be done universally; since the classification is an expression of local geomorphology, the area of interest must first be carefully delineated before proceeding. Classes defined in this way may be very useful in accurately defining landforms, but hard to convert to practical use.",

These are:\n\nMd soils effectively have no stone or bedrock. Leave the property undefined.\nRock class is only defined in reference to stones &gt; 2 mm and bedrock (where encountered within 100 cm). The rock class of the fine earth fraction is accounted for below.\nThe ‘deep and stoneless’ classes (Mt, Md, So and Sd) can still have a total of &lt; 3% by volume stones in the top 100 cm.\nInclude pumice in rock class only where pumice strength is more than ‘extremely weak’ (Lynn and Crippen 1991, p. 10) - i.e., it can only be broken by hand with difficulty. If the pumice’s lithology is uncertain, use the dominant lithology of the probable volcano of origin (e.g. Rh in the Taupō Volcanic Centre and An around Taranaki).\nWhere in-profile stone lithology contrasts with bedrock lithology, two codes separated by ‘/’ can be used e.g. Sc/Gw.\nWhere two lithologies are close to co-dominant in a stony profile, two codes separated by ‘+’ can be used e.g. An+Rh.\nMore complicated combinations are not allowed, e.g. no An+Rh/Gw.\n\n\n\n24.1.2.2 Rock class of fines\nThe same rock class codes in Table 24.2 can be applied to report the dominant lithology of the fine earth (&lt; 2 mm) fraction of the full profile. Again, some restrictions apply:\n\nSd soils and Mf soils effectively have no fine earth fraction. Leave the property undefined.\nWhere a lithological discontinuity exists in the profile, two codes separated by ‘/’ can be used e.g. Sc/Gw.\nWhere two lithologies are close to co-dominant, two codes separated by ‘+’ can be used e.g. An+Rh.\nMore complicated combinations are not allowed, e.g. no An+Rh/Sm+Ss/Gw.\n\n\n\n\n24.1.3 Family texture class\nThe family texture class describes the dominant character of the top 60 cm, or to the profile material class-defining rock or gravel layer contact if that is shallower. Use the codes in Table 24.3. Note that 18% organic carbon corresponds to approximately 30% organic matter.\n\n\n\n\nTable 24.3: Family texture classes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nOrgc\nSilt\nClay\n\n\n\n\nc\nClayey\n&lt; 18\n-\n≥ 35\n\n\ns\nSandy\n&lt; 18\n&lt; 40\n&lt; 8\n\n\nl\nLoamy\n&lt; 18\n&lt; 40\n≥ 8 - &lt; 35\n\n\nz\nSilty\n&lt; 18\n≥ 40\n≥ 8 - &lt; 35\n\n\np\nPeaty\n≥ 18\n-\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24.1.4 Permeability class\nThis class estimates the permeability of the top 100 cm in units of mm/hr.

It describes how soil parent materials have arrived at the point of observation. Allowable codes are listed in Table 24.5.\nMultiple modes may have operated in different parts of the soil profile. Up to two may be recorded at Family level, in order of their occurrence down-profile (e.g. Tp/Fl). If PMO has been recorded at horizon level and more than two have been identified, the dominant two must be chosen on the basis of their cumulative thickness. Cumulative thicknesses &lt;20 cm should be ignored unless the layers include a significant pedological feature (e.g. a pan).\n\n\n\n\nTable 24.5: Parent material origin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAn\nAnthropic\nDeposits made by the direct actions of humans, including truncation, mixing, or deposition.\n\n\nCl\nColluvium\nWeathered soil and rock material mantling slopes that has been transported primarily by gravity and sheet wash.\n\n\nFl\nAlluvium\nSediments that have been deposited by streams, rivers and other running water.\n\n\nGl\nGlacial till\nPoorly stratified, poorly sorted rock fragments, sand and mud, surface or near-surface deposits resulting from the transportation by and deposition from ice or meltwater from beneath or in close proximity to glacial ice.\n\n\nLc\nLacustrine\nFormed in and around lake beds; comprising extremely fine sediment deposited under very low-flow freshwater conditions.\n\n\nMr\nMarine\nUnconsolidated sediments saturated by brackish or saline water.\n\n\nLh\nLahar\nA flow of volcanic material, both ash and coarser products, mixed with water; often caused by the spilling over of a crater lake.

Note that this is deeper than the family-level texture control section. The following rules apply:\n\nMf, Mr, Ma, Ml, and Mp soils must match their family texture code (c, s, l, or z).\nSl and Sp soils must use one of Tp, Tc, Tl or Ts to align with their family texture code of p.\nSd soils must use Tp.\nUpper and lower textures can be defined for other soil profile classes, but only the dominant two are recorded. Both contributing layers must be at least 20 cm thick.\nWhen there are more than two texture layers within the control section, then the texture profile is identified according to the uppermost texture contrast.\n\nFor example, if a sandy horizon occurs at 80 cm depth and a clayey horizon overlays a silty horizon at 40 cm, then the texture contrast is reported as clayey over silty (c/z) and the sandy layer is ignored.\n\nSilty and loamy horizons are not considered contrasting and can be added together where contiguous.\n\nFor example, a profile with silty (0–15 cm) over loamy (15–25 cm) over sandy (25-90 cm) is considered to have a contrasting upper layer of 25 cm, and is identified as silty over sandy (z/s). The texture specification uses the uppermost of the silty or loamy layers together with the lower layer.\n\nSkeletal horizons (k) may only be used for Ms, Mm, Mt and So soils. The skeletal material must be non-tephric.\nSkeletal horizons in moderately deep gravelly soils (Mg) are ignored in favour of describing the overlying fine sediments.\n\nUse the codes in Table 24.8 to assign sibling level texture class(es).\n\n\n\n\nTable 24.8: Sibling texture classes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nOrganic Carbon %\nSilt %\nClay %\nStone %\n\n\n\n\nk\nSkeletal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n≥ 35\n\n\nTp\nPeat or litter\n≥ 30\n\n\n\n\n&lt; 35\n\n\nTc\nClayey peat\n≥ 18 - &lt; 30\n\n\n≥ 35\n&lt; 35\n\n\nTl\nLoamy peat\n≥ 18 - &lt; 30\n\n\n≥ 8 - &lt; 35\n&lt; 35\n\n\nTs\nSandy peat\n≥ 18 - &lt; 30\n&lt; 40\n&lt; 8\n&lt; 35\n\n\nc\nClayey\n&lt; 18\n\n\n≥ 35\n&lt; 35\n\n\ns\nSandy\n&lt; 18\n&lt; 40\n&lt; 8\n&lt; 35\n\n\nl\nLoamy\n&lt; 18\n&lt; 40\n≥ 8 - &lt; 35\n&lt; 35\n\n\nz\nSilty\n&lt; 18\n≥ 40\n&lt; 3\n&lt; 35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24.2.4 Drainage\nProfile drainage is determined from horizon depths and per-horizon drainage ratings completed according to Section 22.3.\n\n\n\n\nTable 24.9: Profile drainage rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nVP\nVery Poor\nProfiles with very poorly drained horizons starting &lt;10cm from the land surface\n\n\nPO\nPoor\nProfiles with poorly drained horizons starting &lt;30cm from the land surface\n\n\nIP\nImperfect\nProfiles with poorly drained horizons starting 30-60cm from the land surface, or Profiles with imperfectly drained horizons starting &lt;30cm from the land surface\n\n\nMW\nModerately Well\nProfiles with moderately well-drained horizons starting &lt;90cm from the surface, or Profiles with poorly-drained horizons starting 60-90cm from the surface, or Profiles with imperfectly drained horizons starting 30-90cm from the surface\n\n\nWE\nWell\nAll horizons starting within 90cm of the surface are well-drained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkers classifying drainage for NZSC Sibling construction have no need to subdivide within those profile ratings. For other types of work e.g. agricultural suitability assessment, it may be useful to recognise subgroups – e.g. for a deep-rooted, wetness-intolerant crop, there’s a difference between a profile that is at its worst imperfectly drained in the top 1 m, vs one that is dominantly imperfectly drained but has poor drainage below 60 cm.\n\n24.2.4.1 Natural vs Artificial drainage\nProfile drainage is often modified by human activity. Many of these modifications require ongoing maintenance. Use the codes in Table 24.10 to signify the degree of drainage modification.\n\n\n\n\nTable 24.10: Profile drainage modification level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nN\nNatural\nNo evidence of human impacts on the local drainage regime\n\n\nM\nMinor\nDrainage regime passively altered by e.g. conversion to or from forest; or ambiguous evidence of any human impacts beyond clearing\n\n\nA\nMajor\nClear evidence of directed human alteration to the drainage regime e.g. drain or dam construction adjacent to site, flow diversions, infill, levelling or contouring works",

A breaker bar or crowbar may also be needed to loosen the soil before excavating.\nHand augers are common tools for rapid profile extraction, but with the exception of gouge augers for soft muds, the degree to which they disturb the soil profile means that they are better off as an accessory tool. Augering is best confined to well-understood landscapes where quick cores are used to confirm that observations made in nearby pits are representative of the area being sampled. Auger heads useful for soil observations include\n\n50 - 100 mm heads for loamy to light clayey soils\n30 - 50 mm heads for lightly gravelly soils\nopen-ended heads for augering in sands and fine gravels\ngouge augers for sampling soft muds\n\nExtendable systems are useful for reaching target depths &gt; 1 m, and systems with shorter rods may offer a better ergonomic experience for shorter workers. Augering safely and efficiently becomes difficult when the handles are above the base of the user’s ribcage.\nC1 (Table 10.3) style tube samplers can be manually inserted with a steel post driver and sampling depths of up to 1 m are usually achievable.\n\n\nA.1.2 Mechanical\nMechanical post drivers can be adapted to push C1 sampling tubes in as deep as 1.5 m, provided the substrate is minimally stony and soil moisture conditions are favourable. Sampling in 30-50 cm sections may be necessary in some cases.\n\n\n\nA researcher using a post driver to extract a C1 style core in the Ranigitikei River valley.\n\n\nSampling in gravelly, dry-clayey or hard-setting soils may not be feasible without the use of an excavator. Compact models that can be moved on a light trailer are preferred. A narrow bucket gives the operator a choice of pit sizes.\n\n\n\nA pedologist using a small excavator to dig a P2 style pit in Northland\n\n\nFor deeper sampling, or work in saturated soils, consider the use of vehicle-mounted dual tube sampling systems, where a C1 core is lined with a removable plastic tube. These are usually pushed into the soil with a hydraulic hammer and the more complex systems can sample to well over 10 m. Another option is vacuum-assisted coring for working below the water table.\nMechanical screw augers are not recommended as they disturb the soil profile too much for a reliable description. Hollow-core screw augers, however, may be able to minimise such disturbance.",

The consistent layout also makes it easier to review data for completeness and correctness, and compare sites.\nData entry forms should be laid out so that the process of filling them out roughly follows the process of field soil description itself. Each section should contain enough room for the parameter being recorded.

    "text": "C.1.1 Cleaning an exposure\n\nLocate a part of the exposure that is safely accessible. Exposures can change rapidly over short distances, so consider the landscape/landform and which section(s) of the exposure might be most representative.\nTrim back or clear overhanging vegetation.\nUse a spade to scrape back at least the first few inches of soil, revealing a fresh face approximately 40-50 cm wide. Try to create a roughly vertical face; this may involve excavating ‘in’ to the exposure surface.\nIf the exposure is less than 1 m tall, some minor excavation may be required to expose the profile to sufficient depth.\nUse a smaller hand tool to finish smoothing back the face (avoid smearing), and then use it to ‘pick out’ the right-hand half of the face in a way that reveals the soil structure (this last part is optional; soils may be too weakly structured or wet for picking to add value).\nFor sandy or dusty soils, brush clean the lower parts of the exposure face, which may have become coated with material from upper horizons. This is especially important when sampling.\nAnchor a pit tape on the left side of the profile, optionally pinning it at the base.\nIf the profile is partly or fuly dry, spray it down lightly with water to bring up the colours consistently across the whole face.\nPhotograph the full profile and then zoom in on ~30 cm sections. Optionally, mark the horizon boundaries with pins and take a second whole-profile photo.\nProceed with the soil description and sampling.\nAfter describing, clean up any spoil, either infilling excavation or sweeping it back out of any adjacent drains.\n\n\n\nC.1.2 Digging a large pit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDigging large soil pits involves safety risks. Make yourself aware of the advice provided by WorkSafe New Zealand around managing excavations, and your responsibilities (WorkSafe New Zealand 2017).\n\n\n\n\nPre-screen potential excavations for underground services. Use ‘dial before you dig’ services and ideally a pipe/cable locator. On farms away from urban services, talk to the landholder about the locations of water supply pipes, gas-line easements and similar.\nOn flat land, choose a pit orientation that will create optimal lighting conditions on the main face. On sloping land above ~10 degrees, orient the pit against the slope to minimise effort and keep the pit structure safe.\nExcavate a large enough area to work in, usually 0.5-1.0 m wide.\n\nWork towards a target depth of 1 m at the main face (or at the very least, the top of the B horizon), leaving steps for access and benching side walls to minimise collapse risk.\nPlace spoil to one side on a tarpaulin, far enough back from the edge that it won’t fall back in. Don’t place spoil uphill.\nIdeally, separate top and subsoil for refilling.\nAvoid compressing or disturbing the surface above the main face.\nIf it is not safe to dig to the target depth, use an auger to sample beyond the safe depth.\nAlways stop excavating at the water table.\n\nClean the main face and prepare it as described for exposures (Section C.1.1).\nProceed with the soil description and sampling.\nAfter describing, refill the pit, tamping down spoil to re-create the former surface as closely as possible.\n\nNote that pits deeper than chest height may rapidly become unsafe. Bracing is recommended past 1 m and required past 1.5 m.\n\n\nC.1.3 Digging a small pit\nSmall pits lack the safety risks of large pits, but locations should still be pre-screened for buried services (see Section C.1.2).\n\nOn flat land, choose a pit orientation that will create optimal lighting conditions on the main face. On sloping land above ~10°, orient the pit against the slope to minimise effort and keep the pit structure safe.\nExcavate a small pit ~1 spade-width wide and 3-4 long, to ~0.6 m deep. Ideally the top 5-10 cm of B horizon should be exposed, so deepen the pit slightly if necessary. Place spoil to one side on a tarpaulin.\nWhere texture and moisture conditions allow: Using the spade, gently excavate a ‘slice’ of the back pit face 5-10 cm thick. Remove the profile in sections, laying it out on a tarpaulin or mat.\nUse a hand auger to pull out the remaining profile to 1.0 m.\nClean up the pit and photograph the inside, with a measuring tape in place. Take horizon depths from the pit face in preference to the extracted profile as they will be more accurate.\nPlace a tape alongside the extracted profile and take photographs.\nProceed with description and sampling.\nRefill the pit, restoring the former ground surface as closely as possible.\n\n\n\nC.1.4 Augering\n\nLay out a tarpaulin or mat to hold the extracted soil.\nUse a spade to remove the first 10-20 cm of profile and/or an overlying litter layer. This allows for accurate determination of surface structure, and avoids having to auger through dense surface plant matter (e.g. pasture grasses).\nAuger to depth, taking care to remove the soil in small sections without overfilling the auger head.\n\nCheck the hole depth with a tape measure every 3-5 extractions, adjusting the extracted soil to match the depth achieved.\nPay attention to the ‘feel’ of the auger; this may change noticeably as new horizons are encountered or the water table is reached. You may need to adjust the amount of downward pressure in response.\n\nDescribe the extracted soil, allowing for parameters that may not be accurately observed using this method.\nRefill the auger hole as far as possible. Use a spade to collapse the top of the hole and recreate a firm surface. This is especially important in paddocks containing livestock.",

    "text": "C.2 Sampling the profile\n\nC.2.1 Preparation\nProfiles exposed in pits are sampled for laboratory analysis to quantify and extend data recorded in the field. The basic sampling units are usually, but not necessarily soil horizons. Normally, all the horizons described are sampled and labelled with field number, soil name, horizon, and depth limits on the sample bag and a plastic paper label placed in with the sample.\n\n\nC.2.2 Sampling for chemical or spectral analysis\nThe following method is for sampling from a pit. This is often done in conjunction with sampling cores which can be taken from within the same block of soil as the chemistry sample to ensure the closest possible relationship between the samples for chemical and physical analysis.\nAt least 1 kg of fine earth ( &lt; 2 mm) should be collected from each horizon sampled and sealed in a polythene bag.\nIf the soil contains fine or medium ( &lt; 20 mm) gravel, more sample should be collected, to ensure that at least 1 kg of &lt; 2 mm material is collected. The larger sample is also needed so that an accurate percentage can be measured during the preparation of the sample. If an appreciable quantity of larger stones are present, other techniques are needed (see below) to quantify the stone content and to measure bulk density (core sampling is not possible), and the &lt; 2 mm sample can be grab-sampled from around the stones.\nThe limits of the horizons should be first marked on the face to be sampled as described in Appendix 4. Whenever possible, samples should be taken one below the other from a representative vertical slice that is 200-500 mm wide and extends far enough into the face of the pit to get sufficient soil from the thinnest horizon. If cores for physical analysis are not being taken from the deepest horizon, it is convenient to sample this horizon first, so that it will not be necessary to re-excavate the bottom of the pit. Before sampling the topsoil, any grass or other vegetation should be trimmed off to ground level with a sharp knife. The top horizon is then sampled and all the surplus soil removed from the full width of the slice leaving a clear step before sampling the next horizon. This process is repeated down the profile, with care taken to avoid contamination by material from overlying horizons. The samples can be taken using a spade held level with the lower boundary of the horizon to collect material loosened by a clean trowel or knife.\nSamples are normally taken from the entire thickness of every horizon identified and separately described. If well defined solids of distinct soil material occur within a horizon (e.g. nodules, concretions) their presence and whether or notthat are included in a bulk sample should be recorded (they are normally included). Significant iron and/or humus pans should be treated as horizons and sampled separately. If any apparently homogeneous topsoil horizon more than 25 cm thick, or lower horizon more than 50 cm thick, is identified it should be divided equally and samples taken from each sub-horizon.\nSamples containing particles of soft rock &gt; 2 mm, concretions or nodules liable to disintegrate when prepared for analysis should be noted and the particulars forwarded to the laboratory with the sample so that special precautions can be taken in its preparation.\n\n\nC.2.3 Composite topsoil sampling\nA number of 0-75 mm cores (between 5 and 10) from around the area of the pit is collected. The purpose of this composite sample is to enable some conclusion to be drawn about the representativeness of the topsoil sampled in the pit. The sample is usually taken from a 300 m^2 area with the core taken beside the left foot every few paces. The corer, however, should not be put through cow ‘pats’ or any other obviously non- representative materials. Also care must be taken not to cross the soil boundary.\nThe composite sample is labelled with the letter ‘z’. A sample from the pit to compare with this composite samples is needed. This pit sample should be 0-75 ± 10 mm in depth. If the topsoil falls within these limits, the normal horizon sample (A sample) is adequate for the purpose. If the A horizon thickness is greater than about 15 cm then a subdivision at 7.5 cm is appropriate. However, if the A horizon is between about 9 and 15 cm it is usually sampled in total and an extra 0-7.5-cm sample (labelled ‘y’) is taken for comparison with the composite (z) sample.\n\n\nC.2.4 Sampling for soil physics\n\nReference Soil Carbon sampling protocol for bulk density - method in text has evolved substantially\n\n\n\n\n\nHeck RJ 2017.

Many numeric soils parameters have no inherent natural breaks, but patterns in their distribution can emerge in specific landscapes or over certain scales of examination.

    "section": "Soil Setting (formerly ‘Site Data’)",
    "text": "Soil Setting (formerly ‘Site Data’)\nThis section has been loosely structured around the major soil forming factors.\n\nADD Chapter Parent material, discussing ways to record geological and lithological information. General commentary on the use of geological maps is included but there is no requirement to record geological map code or similar, due to scale and purpose differences. Two options for lithology recording are presented (NZLRI rock type, NZSC Family Rock Class). The mineralogy classes used in the NZSC are also included as an optional parameter.\nSome commentary on available research-grade rock type vocabularies is also included. Longer term, the description manual should consider adopting one of these, but they need further development.\nADD Chapter Soils, describing additional sources of New Zealand soils knowledge.\nUPDATE ‘Location of profile position’ to Location and describe modern methods of recording site location, including elevation.\nUPDATE ‘Annual precipitation’ to Climate and Weather, build out a broader discussion of recommended climate and weather parameters, and available data sources.\nUPDATE ‘Geomorphic position’ to Geomorphology, with a more structured method of geomorphology description.\n\nThe ‘P’, ‘S’, ‘E’ scales of examination previously described on p. 12 of Milne et al. (1995) are loosely retained as Landscape, Landform and Site, but the details of their expression differ.\nSlope and aspect are retained as optional measurements. How they are recorded varies with scale of examination.\nSlope length and width are no longer required to be measured in-field, as this is generally impractical and slope width has no inherent relevance to soil character. Options for computation from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) or measurement in GIS are mentioned.\n‘Wave length and amplitude’ is replaced by the simpler term ‘relief’ and is only recorded at Landscape scale. The definition is the same. A relief classification is added in 23.3 Relief classification.\nAssessment of rock outcrop and boulder cover at the site is moved to 11.3 Surface cover.\nGeomorphic word descriptors (p.15-22) have been regrouped into the Landscape/Landform structure the highly local ones been moved to ‘natural microrelief’, 11.6.1 Natural Microrelief.\nThe user is referred to Soil and Terrain (2023), p. 26-29 for detailed description of drainage channels, if needed. This is optional.\n\nUPDATE ‘Vegetation’ to Biota to allow discussion of when and how to describe other soil-influencing organisms.\n\nREMOVE the vegetation description standard (p. 25-31) and replace with cross-references to appropriate existing standards. The RECCE method is now recommended for high-detail work, and the LUC Vegetation classes for routine assessment. The LCDB can be used for rapid assessment.\nRationale The measurement standards given don’t align with how vegetation is currently recorded by NZ botanists. The ‘Atkinson’ structural classes in Table 2 are not in common use and have the additional problem of grouping all forests into one category, which has very limited discriminatory power. Soils in NZ are known to be heavily influenced by specific types of past and present forest cover, rednering the scheme suboptimal.\n\nUPDATE ‘Land use and land-management practices’ to Land cover, land use, and land management. The section now suggests using the proposed NZ Land Use Classification (Law 2024) for land use and the existing Land Cover Database for land cover. Land management codes have been replaced with a discussion of potential land management practices that may be recorded (no codes are provided). The land management practice codes previously listed on p. 33-34 have been migrated to the following code lists:\n\nEvidence of drainage works affecting the site is now recorded as part of profile drainage assessment (24.2.4.1 Natural vs Artificial drainage).\nEvidence of localised human alteration to the land surface is now recorded as anthropogenic microrelief (11.6.2 Anthropogenic microrelief).\nMost remaining codes are now recorded as ‘recent site disturbances’ (10.3 Recent site disturbance).\n\nMOVE Erosion and deposition from Soil Setting to Soil Profile.",

This is replaced by advocating for a profile identifier that includes a project-level grouping code, and some more generic advice about identifiers.\nREMOVE requirement for soil series name and classification. These are interpretations, not metadata.\n\nADD a non-optional code-set for exposure type (10.2.7 Exposure type), documenting the method by which the soil was exposed for assessment (pit, auger etc).\nADD a requirement to record the maximum depth of observation (or calculate it from horizon depth data)\nADD a code list for recording the reason a soil profile did not reach 100 cm\nADD a code list for recording recent site disturbances that have the capacity to impact the soil profile description.\n\n\n\nSoil surface\n\nADD site-specific slope and aspect recording instructions.

This includes surface stone and outcrop.\nREMOVE reference to ‘fresh’ or ‘aged’ samples (Milne et al. 1995, p. 35); soil descriptions should only be carried out on fresh soil materials.\nUPDATE Separate Erosion/Deposition into two sets of three-part descriptive codes to allow easier recording of distinct processes affecting the surface (11.7 Erosion, 11.8 Deposition). Rapid noting of erosion and deposition can be made using site disturbance codes; these are optional extras that allow a little more detail to be communicated.\n\nUPDATE gravity-driven erosion codes for international compatibility\nADD subtypes of wind deposition for volcanic ash, sand and silt\nADD subtypes of water deposition for flood, storm surge and glacial action\n\n\n\n\nDefining soil horizons\n\nADD a clear statement about the differences between the land surface, the soil surface, and the soil mineral surface\nADD separate instructions for recording horizon depths, based on whether a large section of profile is visible and on whether detailed assessment is desired (12.5 Boundary distinctness)\nADD guidance on accurately recording horizon boundaries on steep slopes (see Important 12.1)\nCHANGE Boundary shape by making ‘occluded’ its own option rather than a modifier placed on the other four categories. It is also renamed to ‘discontinuous’. This improves international compability (12.4 Boundary shape)\nADD a clear statement about when to switch from recording a diffuse horizon transition to defining a new horizon. 30 cm is the proposed cutoff. (12.5 Boundary distinctness)\nREMOVE Table 3 ‘soil water state and soil water potential’ in favour of using the soil water status codes in Table 4. Applying Table 3 correctly requires a tensiometer and/or laboratory data. The schema in Table 4 aligns more closely with international soil water status description requirements.",

    "text": "Soil horizons\n\nSoil horizon description\n\nADD an option to record parent material origin on each horizon, using the NZSC Family Profile Material Origin codes. Modifiers are presented for subtypes of Anthropic materials. This practice is recommended as it helps when classifying Anthropic soils, provides a shorthand option for highlighting the NZSC diagnostic Fluvial Features, and adds valuable context to horizon descriptions.\n\n\n\nSoil architecture\nThis section comprises a considerable revision of the ‘Macrofabric’ section of Milne et al. (1995). Components are more clearly separated and options for both rapid and detailed assessment are given.\n\nUPDATE pedality grade to describe a clear gradient of progressively stronger ped development (Single-grain –&gt; Massive –&gt; Weak –&gt; Moderate –&gt; Strong). Separate non-ped structures into a ‘D = disturbed’ grade.\nADD ped shape ‘angular blocky’. Consistent with international standards; useful for the extremely squared-off peds that can be observed in, e.g., Pumice soils.\nREMOVE ped shape ‘tabular’. Exists in no other system, appears to be a synonym for platy.\nREMOVE ped shape ‘cylindrical’. Exists in no other system\nREMOVE ped shape ‘cast’. Casts are now described separately in 17.5 Biological features.\nREMOVE Figure 8 and 9 flowcharts - redundant\nREMOVE shape options ‘botryoidal’ and ‘stellate’ as their utility is unclear\nREMOVE the requirement to measure inclination of all soil macrofabric components\nParts of the former Appendix 6 ‘Procedures for describing macrofacbric’ have been moved into this section, providing clear instructions on how to assess pedality.\nCHANGE Switch from counting roots per square unit area to estimating volumetric percentage in a horizon or sample. Counting individual roots is impractical at both very small and very large size ranges. Estimating volumetric percentage of the horizon brings roots into alignment with abundance assessment of other soil components (textures, stone, artefacts, voids), allowing total soil compositional data to be calculated.\nUPDATE list of void types to provide simpler options. Rename Krotovina to Tunnel to reduce jargon.\nUPDATE Clearly separate the description of large voids from small pores.\nMOVE description of ped surface features, concentrations, and infilled voids to ‘Secondary Features’.\nADD optional detailed description terms for plastics.\n\n\n\nSoil colour\n\nADD clear instructions for accurately recording colour in the field, as well as notes about colour vision acuity and the use of technology like colour sensors and cameras\nADD a direct statement about the definition of the matrix colour, as it differs from most other systems which choose based on areal dominance alone.\nADD codes for colour pattern type. NB Patterns from mixing by mechanical or biological means are not distinguished as the presence of such disturbances is recorded in several other ways (site disturbance, horizon names, secondary features)\n\n\n\nSoil texture\n\nADD commentary clarifying the differences between hand texture and laboratory particle size analysis\nADD a table of clay/silt/sand ranges for the NZ texture triangle\nUPDATE the triangle diagram for better visual clarity\nADD an option for rapid texture assessment, compatible with S-Map and the NZSC\n\n\n\nSecondary features\n\nADD options for detailed descriptions of pans\nUPDATE description of concentrations to allow rapid or detailed assessment\nUPDATE code lists for concentrations, pans, coatings and pressure features to separate the various concepts more clearly and provide rapid and detailed assessment options for both.\n\n\n\nConsistence tests\n\nADD infobox discussing which tests may be required when classifying against the NZSC\nConsistence tests have been re-written with clear, step by step instructions. The evaluation criteria are unchanged, except for the following:\nREMOVE reference to the use of handheld penetrometers and Singleton blades, as these are no longer common practice\n\n\n\nField tests\n\nChemical field tests have been rewritten with clear, step by step instructions and are accompanied by equipment lists and improved safety warnings.\nADD infobox discussing which tests may be required when classifying against the NZSC\nREMOVE instructions for sand content by boiling oxalate, P-retention, and organic properties; these should be done in the laboratory.",
