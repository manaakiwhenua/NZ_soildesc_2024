# Climate

- note: not weather! most of this is better off not measured in-field
- note: limitations of available climate data, use local records where possible
- talk about getting data from LENZ vs more local sources
- calculation from terrain for insolation

## Global-Regional

- Koppen
- most work programs will take place within one zone
- Season (WRB list)

## Local

### Rainfall regime

- total annual
- rainfall seasonality (mean/sd off monthly totals)
- summer/winter ratio  (Dec+Jan+Feb)/(June+Jul+Aug)

### Temperature regime

- mean annual, etc
- frostiness

### Insolation regime

- day length average and variability

### Prevailing winds

- direction, strength by season
- rationale: aspect effects
