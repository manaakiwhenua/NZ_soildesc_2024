A soil horizon is a distinct zone that can be identified within a soil profile, usually but not always parallel to the land surface. Soil horizons are distinguished by differences in texture, stoniness, structure, colour, consistence or other soil properties as described in the following sections. Delineated horizons should ideally represent depth intervals over which important soil attributes change minimally, although some short-range internal variation may occur. Conversely, the horizon boundaries should represent depth intervals over which there is a relatively high rate of change of important soil properties. Soil horizons emerge from a complex interaction of differentiating and homogenising forces, the detailed discussion of which is beyond the scope of this handbook. See @hartemink2020 and @palmer2025 for further reading.

Soil horizons are commonly grouped into two major zones - the topsoil, where biological activity is elevated and new additions of soil parent material may be received, and the subsoil, a zone where weathering processes are concentrated, generating new soil minerals and accumulating materials from above. Below these zones, collectively called the 'solum', a 'subsolum' of variably weathered soil parent materials continues, often for many meters. These materials can include paleosols buried by subsequent depositional events, unconsolidated deposits that have not been subject to strong weathering, and rocks weathering in place. In New Zealand, many landscapes are underlain by sedimentary rocks that were not strongly consolidated before becoming exposed to weathering forces, so the boundary between the solum and the subsolum can be particularly difficult to define.

While this handbook focuses primarily on describing the solum, the subsolum, when encountered, should be described as well. Subsolum materials play a key role in deep drainage, groundwater recharge, slope stability, and ecological support [@juilleret2016]. 'Horizon' boundaries within the subsolum will most commonly relate to lithological or depositional discontinuities.

::: {#nte-hzn-cls .callout-note collapse="true" appearance="simple" title="Soil horizons and classification systems"}
All soil classification systems use particular soil horizons to help locate a soil within the system. To be classification-relevant, such horizons must not be merely present but must also meet particular thresholds of development, e.g. by having a minimum thickness or a particular abundance range for a key property.

## Defining the soil surface {#sec-pr-ssurf}

The soil surface has a slightly more restrictive definition than the land surface. The soil surface begins below the layer of fresh leaf litter or small living plants, and at the top of organic soil materials such as decomposing litter or peat. The mineral soil surface is further restricted, identified as the top of the first horizon that is dominated by mineral soil material. Horizon depths are defined with reference to the soil surface overall - thus only fresh litter and/or small plants should be scraped back before measuring.

## Recording depths {#sec-pr-depths}

Horizon depths are recorded starting from the soil surface at 0 cm and working downwards cumulatively.

When examining single small cores or auger points (see @tbl-pr-gear, type [A]{.ceg}, [C1]{.ceg} and perhaps [C2]{.ceg}), record the observable upper and lower boundary depths of each horizon from the soil surface in whole centimetres (e.g. [28-38 cm]{.ceg}).

Where a wider exposure (see @tbl-pr-gear, type [E]{.ceg}, [P1]{.ceg}, [P2]{.ceg}) or multiple undisturbed cores are available and greater detail is desired, one may choose to record upper and lower boundary depths as a median and range, again in whole centimetres (e.g. [28 cm (27-29), 38 cm (37-40)]{.ceg}). At least 5 measurements should contribute to such an assessment. This practice may be useful for describing irregular, convolute or discontinuous horizons (@sec-pr-bdyshp).

Measure boundaries to and from the midpoint of each horizon transition zone (see @sec-pr-bdydist). Where depths are correctly measured, horizon thicknesses can be calculated after fieldwork.

::: {#imp-stp .callout-important collapse="true" appearance="simple" title="Defining horizons on steep slopes"}
On steeper slopes, measuring horizons from vertical exposures can exaggerate horizon thicknesses, as the soil horizons mantle the landscape perpendicular to the sloping surface [@prietzel2019]. This starts to matter at slopes \> 25°, and progressively becomes more important - especially when calculating volumetric stocks of soil components. @fig-hr-slpex shows how a vertical 30-cm depth represents a progressively shallower 'true depth' as slope increases.

Where depths are measured perpendicular to the surface, no adjustment needs to be made. To adjust vertically measured horizon depths to correct for slope, apply the formula $depth * cos(slope)$. Supply depth in cm and slope in radians. Slopes measured in degrees can be converted to radians using the formula $(slope * pi) / 180$. If this correction is made, record that it has been done in the site notes to prevent the horizon depths from being adjusted any further.

```{r}
#| label: fig-hr-slpex
#| fig-cap: "Depth exaggeration by slope."

deg2rad <- function(deg) {(deg * pi) / (180)}

slp_dat <- data.frame('Slope' = seq(0, 50, 1),
                      'Thickness' = 30 * cos(deg2rad(seq(0, 50, 1)))) |>
                        mutate('Ratio' = Thickness/30)

ggplot(slp_dat) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Thickness, x = Slope),
            linewidth = 1, colour = 'grey40') +
  labs(x= 'Slope (°)', y = 'Horizon thickness (cm)') +
  theme_minimal()

## Boundary shape {#sec-pr-bdyshp}

Horizon boundary shape can only be observed on wider exposures (see @tbl-pr-gear, type [E]{.ceg}, [P1]{.ceg}, [P2]{.ceg}). Record using one of the options in @tbl-hr-bshp. Note that the boundary shape is associated with the lower boundary of any given horizon, so the lowest horizon described on a profile may have an undefined boundary shape if profile exposure stopped early (@sec-pr-rsa). In that case, use code [N]{.ceg}.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-hr-bshp
#| tbl-cap: "Horizon boundary shape"

dat_hr_bshp <-
  tribble(~Code, ~Name, ~Description,

## Boundary distinctness {#sec-pr-bdydist}

Horizon boundaries mark changes in soil properties over short vertical distances. The distinctness is variable, from very sudden to gradual, and can signify particular soil characteristics (e.g. a change in parent material). Horizon boundary distinctness is used when classifying soils. Measure the distinctness of a horizon's lower boundary in terms of its width. Report a median and range in 0.1 centimetre increments (e.g. [2.0 cm +/- 0.5 cm]{.ceg}).

For rapid assessment, horizon boundary distinctness can be noted using one of the options in @tbl-hr-bdst.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-hr-bdst
#| tbl-cap: "Horizon boundary distinctness"

dat_hr_bdst <-

                                   align  = 'center')),
            locations = cells_body(columns = 1)) |>
  cols_width(Code ~pct(10), Name ~pct(20))

```

Where a transition is thicker than 30 cm, it should be defined as a new horizon. Use transitional horizon names as needed (see @sec-hor-tran).

## Infill features {#sec-pr-inf}

Infill features are interruptions to the horizonation pattern caused by relatively recent biological or physical disturbances. Infill features are large enough that they can usually only be clearly observed at exposures or large pit faces. The interruption may extend across several horizons, and the infilled material may be from adjacent horizon(s) or comprise reworked material from the affected horizon(s). Where infill features are present, note the type using the options in @tbl-hr-infl, the horizons affected, and the infill material using the options in @tbl-hr-infm.

E.g., [C (1-3) T]{.ceg} for infilled shrink-swell cracks extending from the surface to the third horizon.

Note that open subsurface voids should be described as per @sec-void, and open surface cracks as per @sec-pr-crack.

## Depth to free water

Depth to free water can be determined from the upper depth of the uppermost [S]{.ceg} saturated horizon (@tbl-hr-soilmst), or may be recorded directly, in whole centimetres. Depending on the soil's transmissivity, the water table may be also become evident by the pit or core filling with water. In this case, wait for the water level to stabilise before measuring.

-   If the water table is not encountered, record [NA]{.ceg}
-   If the water table is encountered, use @tbl-hr-frw to code its position in the profile, then record its depth above or below the soil surface in whole centimetres. Do not record negative numbers to signify a water table above the surface.
-   If the water table is exactly at the soil surface, record ['B 0']{.ceg}.

e.g. ['B 80']{.ceg} for a profile saturated below 80 cm depth; ['A 1']{.ceg} for a saturated and barely-walkable peat.

## Parent materials {#sec-pr-pm}

Information about the lithology, origin and weathering degree of the soil parent materials is essential for accurate classification and helps contextualise analytical data.

### Lithology {#sec-pr-lith}

The lithology of the fine earth (mineral particles \<2 mm) and of rock fragments (if present) are noted separately for each soil horizon. Where subsolum layers are observed, their lithology is also noted. Use the codes in @tbl-ss-pm.

Example: [An, Hs]{.ceg} for a mix of eroded sedimentary rocks and volcanic ash.

### Weathering {#sec-pr-wdeg}

The effects of weathering and pedogenesis vary down-profile (usually, but not always, decreasing with depth). Horizons that have experienced limited weathering may require specific descriptors (e.g. texture (@sec-tex-rec) cannot be determined on slightly weathered rocks, but bedding (@sec-reg-bed) may need to be described), so the need for these should be assessed early in the description process. Use the guidance in @tbl-pr-wdeg to clearly identify the solum, as well as any subsolum materials encountered.

::: {#nte-stp .callout-note collapse="true" appearance="simple" title="Degree of weathering and the New Zealand Soil Classification"}
For the purposes of classifying soils according to the New Zealand Soil Classification, profiles overlying a layer of Lithic material as defined in @tbl-pr-wdeg would qualify for the 'lithic contact', while profiles overlying Saprolithic or Paralithic material would qualify for the 'paralithic contact'.

### Origin {#sec-pr-orig}

Parent material origin, or mode of emplacement, describes how soil parent materials have arrived at the point of observation. Multiple modes may have operated in different parts of the soil profile. For soil materials that have weathered from rocks *in situ*, the mode of emplacement is recorded as the last major formation process that left the rocks in a place where they could start weathering into soil.

Record one parent material origin code per soil horizon, using the codes in @tbl-ss-pmo. At the horizon level, the [An]{.ceg} Anthropic class can be subdivided by origin using the codes in @tbl-hr-antype (e.g. [Ann]{.ceg} for a fill pad in a residential housing development).
