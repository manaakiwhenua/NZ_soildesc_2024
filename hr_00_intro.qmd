## Identification



## Composition

Each soil horizon is first described in terms of its broad composition. Composition is divided into 

- Mineral fraction
    - fine earth (mineral particles < 2mm)
    - rock fragments (mineral particles > 2mm)
- Biological fraction
   - Fine organic matter
   - Coarse organic matter (timber, plant roots)
- Liquid fraction (moisture content)
- Voids

These fractions are all measured as percentage by volume.
