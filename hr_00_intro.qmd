## Architecture {#sec-arch}

The architecture of the physical components - how they are spatially arranged - is described in terms of the fine earth structure (@sec-hr-stru), as well as volumetric percentages of other soil components. For more detailed assessments, options for describing these components in more detail are presented. Assessment of the fine earth fraction is covered in

## Colour and Texture {#sec-coltex}

Soil colour and colour patterns are described in @sec-hr-col. The behaviour of the fine-earth fraction is assessed in @sec-hr-tex.

## Pedogenic features

Secondary features that result from pedogenic processes are described in @sec-secondary.

## Physical properties {#sec-phys}

Composition and architecture give rise to particular soil physical behaviours. These can be assessed in the field using the tests in @sec-cons.

## Chemical properties {#sec-chemi}

Soil chemistry can be partially assessed in the field using the tests in @sec-chem.
