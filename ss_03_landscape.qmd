Geomorphology limits the range of soils than can occur at specific locations on the basis of slope, relief, aspect, and drainage. Geomorphology can be described at multiple scales, which break down into progressively simpler shapes. The system described in this chapter helps the pedologist to do that consistently. In this system, the chosen scales are Province (@sec-gmph-prov), Landscape (@sec-gmph-lsc), and Landform (@sec-gmph-lfm) as described below. Some additional, highly local geomorphology parameters are captured when describing the land surface at a site (@sec-pr-surface).

## Province {#sec-gmph-prov}

Provinces identify major geomorphic zones in New Zealand, expressive of large-scale lithological associations, tectonic regime, and climate. @tbl-ss-lftp lists their names and @fig-ss-lftp shows their general distribution. Full definitions of the provinces are in @sec-ap-prov.

: Landscape provinces of New Zealand {#tbl-ss-lftp .hover .striped tbl-colwidths="\[5,29,5,28,5,28\]"}

![Landscape provinces of New Zealand - indicative spatial distribution.](data/NZ_provinces.png){#fig-ss-lftp .lightbox width="85%" fig-alt="A map of New Zealand depicting the boundaries of landform Provinces."}

Given their very broad extent, province does not need to be recorded in the field. However, the province boundaries are not currently strictly defined so an understanding of their conceptual basis (@sec-ap-prov) is required before a confident allocation can be made.

## Landscape {#sec-gmph-lsc}

The landscape around a soil observation comprises a distinct geomorphological pattern with repeating elements. The scale of observation varies but commonly extends from a few hundred to a few thousand meters [@heck2017]. Landscapes nest within Provinces but are not exclusive to one or another.

### Parameterising landscapes {#sec-gmph-lscpar}

A landscape can be described in terms of a short list of parameters: relief, characteristic slope, drainage pattern, and the landforms contained within the landscape.

#### Relief {#sec-gmph-lscrel}

Relief is the degree of separation between high and low points in a landscape. As described in @ncst2024 [p. 36], relief can be visualised by picturing two surfaces roughly parallel to the land surface - one passing through local crests and one through local depressions. The median vertical distance between the two surfaces is the relief.

[add a diagram here]{.diags}

Relief is usually best determined from a DEM, but can be estimated in the field. Record in whole meters if estimating, e.g. [55 m]{.ceg}. Relief classes may be applied to the recorded data; see @sec-reliefclass.

#### Characteristic slope {#sec-gmph-lscslp}

The characteristic slope is the most common range of slopes within a regional landscape. These are often controlled by local geology.

Characteristic slope is usually best determined from zonal analysis of a DEM-derived slope dataset, but can be estimated in the field. Estimate in the field as a median and range, in whole degrees, e.g. [25° (20-28)]{.ceg}. Slope classes may be applied to the recorded data; some options are presented in @sec-slopeclass.

::: {#nte-multislopes .callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true" title="Multiple characteristic slopes"}
Some landscapes may have two or more distinct characteristic slopes, e.g. the fronts and tops of alluvial terrace elements. In this case the median will describe the dominant surface while the range will capture the steeper areas. Recording multiple characteristic slopes at landscape scale is not considered useful, as adequate context is provided by naming the landscape and its component landforms.
:::

#### Stream channels {#sec-gmph-lscchn}

Natural stream channel patterns are relevant to understanding landscape development, but are best observed remotely. They do not need to be recorded in the field. If desired, assess the landscape drainage pattern using available data sources and define it using the stream channel attributes given in [-@ncst2024, p. 38-41].

#### Landscape description {#sec-gmph-lscdsc}

Few controlled vocabularies for landscapes exist. The schema given in @tbl-gmph-lsnames below is provisional and based on terms seen in common use in New Zealand environmental datasets.

#### Composition {#sec-gmph-lsccmp}

A breakdown of the major landforms expected within the landscape should be included (see @sec-gmph-lfm below) along with an estimate of their relative dominance (e.g. [Cs: Bc 80%, Du 10%, Cl 10%]{.ceg} for a coastal landscape comprising steep cliffs fronted by a narrow beach system with some limited dune development in places where the beach is wide enough to allow it).

## Landform {#sec-gmph-lfm}

A landform is a component of the landscape, and again can have a variable extent - usually 10's to 100's of meters. A landform has a relatively simple shape and is not itself composed of multiple repeating elements in the way that a landscape is. A landform has a characteristic range of slopes and aspects. Landforms also have distinctive composition in terms of geology/parent materials and are usually restricted to particular locations within a landscape.

### Describing landforms {#sec-gmph-lfmdsc}

Where available landforms are unsatisfactory or a more detailed parameterisation of the landform is desired, the landform can optionally be described in terms of its slope, orientation and element.

#### Slope {#sec-gmph-lfmslp}

Record the characteristic slope of the major part of the landform as median and range in whole degrees, e.g. [5° (4-6)]{.ceg} for a low-angle fan. Slope classes may be applied to the recorded data; some options are presented in @sec-slopeclass.

#### Orientation {#sec-gmph-lfmori}

For simpler sloping landforms, record orientation as the characteristic aspect of the major part of the landform. Record median and range in whole degrees, e.g. [315 (300-330)]{.ceg} for a roughly northwest direction. For complex landforms with a range of aspects, record the orientation of the landform's longest axis, looking downslope (e.g. the direction in which a valley bottom is descending). Some landforms may not have an identifiable orientation (e.g. cones, saddles), in which case record [NA]{.ceg}.

Aspect classes may be applied to the recorded data; some options are presented in @sec-aspectclass.

#### Landform element {#sec-gmph-lfmelem}

The following is adapted from [-@ncst2024, pp. 19-25].

A landform element is the simplest component of a landform, and some landforms are made up of only one element. Landform elements are first assigned to a morphological type - one of a series of simple shapes - at the scale of observation. These are given in @tbl-gmph-elnames below.

Note that these are paired mirror images, e.g. a closed depression is the opposite of a crest. Each morphological type extends to a break of slope or point of 0-curvature.

Slopes can be further refined by including information about their relationship to their neighbouring elements. Up and down slope, four options are available.

This combination of properties gives rise to more complex shapes. For example, an open hollow could be described as an enclosed maximal slope ([SL A L]{.ceg}). A shoulder would be an exposed waxing slope ([SL X E]{.ceg}). Adding further information about slope and aspect can define a complete element. For instance, for a gently sloping, northeast facing fan - [5 40 SL N E]{.ceg}.

[TODO add graphics]{.diags}

## Other terrain parameters {#sec-gmph-other}

The following terrain parameters may be useful in particular contexts.

### Slope length {#sec-gmph-slplgt}

Slope length is used in assessments of erosion vulnerability. Length is measured from the point at which a slope becomes steep enough to lose soil to erosion processes (see @sec-pr-erosion), to where it levels out enough to receive soils (or to a drainage channel). This is usually impractical to measure in the field, but can be determined computationally given an appropriately detailed DEM. Alternatively, the slope length can be manually traced in GIS.

### Exposure {#sec-gmph-exp}

The degree to which a location is exposed or sheltered by the surrounding topography can be measured at multiple scales and may be useful in studies of soil water behaviour and when completing agricultural suitability assessments.

The Mesoscale Topographic Index (MTI, @hurst2022) is a measure of how sheltered or exposed a location is within a landscape. To measure in the field, use a compass and clinometer to measure angle to the horizon at the 8 cardinal compass bearings. Record positive values if looking up and negative when looking down. The average of the eight values defines the index, with high values signifying a sheltered area and low values signifying exposure.

Terrain shape index (TSI, @hurst2022) is a localised version of MTI, where slope angles are measured at cardinal compass points 20 m from the point of observation, rather than to the horizon. This measures exposure at the site scale of observation. Average exposure at the scale of the landform can be built from multiple TSI measurements taken across the landform.

For both measures, shelter from trees is usually excluded from the assessment - on-ground measurements are taken to the land surface, whose position is estimated if the horizon is obscured.

::: {#tip-automti .callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="minimal" title="Automating exposure measurements"}
The closest automated equivalents of the MTI appear to be the 'Morphometric Protection Index' (MPI) as implemented in SAGA-GIS [@yokoyama2002; @conrad2015], and the 'intensity' output of the 'Geomorphons' module as implemented in GRASS-GIS [@jasiewicz2013; @grassdevelopmentteam2023]. In the case of geomorphon intensity, the output also reports the mean relative elevation in meters of the 8 defining points rather than their average angles above or below the central point.

Field and computer-based measurement of MTI may differ slightly. The in-field version measures against magnetic north rather than 'map north', which will vary with spatial data projection. Calculations can also be made from a Digital Surface Model (DSM, a surface that includes e.g., trees and buildings) or the more usual Digital Terrain Model (DTM).

The TSI can also be calculated using the automated tools mentioned above, but will require a DEM with high vertical accuracy and cell size no more than 10 m.
