# Introduction

The intent of updating the New Zealand soils description standard is to produce a document that can describe a soil profile and its landscape context in a way that effectively informs agronomic, ecological, and research applications. This includes, but is not limited to, applications like

-	Soil mapping at regional and farm scale
-	Land use evaluations e.g., crop suitability assessments.
-	On-farm decision-making e.g., determining fertiliser application rates.
-	Land restoration activities e.g., revegetation.

Engineering applications are considered out of scope, but relationships can and should be drawn between this standard and e.g., International and New Zealand geotechnical standards.

The document aims to support the requirements of the NZ Soil Classification, and, wherever possible, be compatible with international soil description and classification standards.
