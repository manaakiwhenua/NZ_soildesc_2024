# Structure

## ped presence

-   single grain
-   massive
-   weak moderate strong

## ped shape

-   standard set but add angular blocky back in
-   be clear about vertical orientation for some shapes
-   note: nut and crumb vs the world

## ped size

-   modal vertical dimension, and horizontal for tabular ped shapes (prism, lens, etc)
-   record in mm

## nesting peds

-   'parting to' etc
-   db note: 1:1 cascading relationship not 1:n at horizon level

## non-ped aggregates

-   clods and fragments from cultivation

unresolved: - distinguishing earthworm casts - peds or nah? - reconciling peds, cutans and other ped coatings, and 'fabric'
