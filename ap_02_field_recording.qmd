# Recording data in the field

Recording field data in a structured format is important because...

## Form design

Using a structured data entry form reduces the chance of forgetting to record particular data points, vs freehand notes. The consistent layout also makes it easier to review data for completeness and correctness, and compare sites.

Data entry forms should be laid out so that the process of filling them out roughly follows the process of field soil description itself.

Forms can be deployed on paper, but they are vulnerable to wind and rain. Note-taking software on touchscreen tablets (e.g. Microsoft OneNote) can be a more robust alternative.

## App-based data entry

Using a purpose-built app for data entry can reduce the double handling inherent to writing notes by hand, increasing efficiency in the field. Apps do come with design, deployment and maintenance overheads that need to be taken into account. At the time of writing there is no consumer-grade app available for recording NZ soils field data, but the ESRI and QGIS spatial software ecosystems have field data entry frameworks that can be adapted for soils fieldwork.

## Taking and Managing photographs

Site photographs provide a valuable record of the profile itself and the nature of the landscape in which it occurs. Photographs taken should include:

- 1-3 landscape shots placing the site in context. Stand well back and where possible, slightly uphill. 
- 1 clear photo of the ground condition around the profile, including a measuring tape or stick for scale
- 1 clear photo of the extracted profile or exposure with a measuring tape for scale. Ideally take this before describing the profile so it can be viewed in a minimally disturbed state
- 3-4 closeup photos of the profile, capturing 30-40cm ranges. These should slightly overlap.

Photographs should be organised on a per profile basis as soon as possible after fieldwork. The quickest method is simply to place them in a folder named after the site ID. Renaming the files can be useful for longer-term storage, but the process can be time-consuming. 


Any further photos of e.g. concretions or other distinctive features are optional.
