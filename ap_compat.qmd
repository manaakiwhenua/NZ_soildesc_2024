# Cross-compatibility

The Soil Description Manual can inform soil and land assessment work carried out under other systems in New Zealand.

## Visual Soil Assessment

The Visual Soil Assessment (VSA, @shepherd2000; @shepherd2000a) is a rapid soil quality assessment method commonly used in New Zealand agronomy. Those parts of the assessment dealing directly with soil morphology can be completed with reference to parts of this guide (@tbl-vsa).

| System | Component | Section | Notes |
|:----------------|:------------------|:----------------|:-------------------|
| Cropping, low slope grazing, hill country | Structure and consistence | @sec-hr-stru | 'Consistence' is used differently in this standard |
| Cropping, low slope grazing, hill country | Soil porosity | @sec-void, @sec-pore |  |
| Cropping, low slope grazing, hill country | Soil colour | @sec-col-matrix | Only colour changes relative to a reference point are considered in VSA so Munsell notation is not required. |
| Cropping, low slope grazing, hill country | Soil mottles | @sec-col-patt |  |
| Cropping, low slope grazing, hill country | Earthworm counts | @sec-fauna-mega |  |
| Cropping | Tillage pan | @sec-pan | Pan type [C]{.ceg} |
| Cropping | Clod development | @sec-hr-stru |  |
| Cropping, hill country | Soil erosion | @sec-pr-dist | @sec-pr-erosion for detailed assessment. |
| Cropping, low slope grazing | Surface ponding | @sec-pr-surfw (presence at time of observation), @sec-weath-rrain (time since rain event) |  |
| Low slope grazing, hill country | Surface relief | @sec-pr-microrn | Natural microrelief type [A]{.ceg} in low-slope areas and [T]{.ceg} on steeper slopes |
| Low slope grazing, hill country | Bare ground | @sec-pr-surfcov | Surface cover types [BE]{.ceg}, [BR]{.ceg}, [BO]{.ceg} |
| Hill country | Topsoil depth | @sec-pr-depths |  |
| Hill country (forestry) | Humus types | @sec-hzn-convp |  |
