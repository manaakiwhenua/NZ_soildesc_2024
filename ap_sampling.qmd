### Preparation {#sec-samp-prep}

[Profiles exposed in pits are sampled for laboratory analysis to quantify and extend data recorded in the field. The basic sampling units are usually, but not necessarily soil horizons. Normally, all the horizons described are sampled and labelled with field number, soil name, horizon, and depth limits on the sample bag and a plastic paper label placed in with the sample.]{.milne}

### Sampling for chemical or spectral analysis {#sec-samp-chem}

[The following method is for sampling from a pit. This is often done in conjunction with sampling cores which can be taken from within the same block of soil as the chemistry sample to ensure the closest possible relationship between the samples for chemical and physical analysis.]{.milne}

[At least 1 kg of fine earth ( < 2 mm) should be collected from each horizon sampled and sealed in a polythene bag.]{.milne}

[If the soil contains fine or medium ( < 20 mm) gravel, more sample should be collected, to ensure that at least 1 kg of < 2 mm material is collected. The larger sample is also needed so that an accurate percentage can be measured during the preparation of the sample. If an appreciable quantity of larger stones are present, other techniques are needed (see below) to quantify the stone content and to measure bulk density (core sampling is not possible), and the < 2 mm sample can be grab-sampled from around the stones.]{.milne}

[The limits of the horizons should be first marked on the face to be sampled as described in Appendix 4. Whenever possible, samples should be taken one below the other from a representative vertical slice that is 200-500 mm wide and extends far enough into the face of the pit to get sufficient soil from the thinnest horizon. If cores for physical analysis are not being taken from the deepest horizon, it is convenient to sample this horizon first, so that it will not be necessary to re-excavate the bottom of the pit. Before sampling the topsoil, any grass or other vegetation should be trimmed off to ground level with a sharp knife. The top horizon is then sampled and all the surplus soil removed from the full width of the slice leaving a clear step before sampling the next horizon. This process is repeated down the profile, with care taken to avoid contamination by material from overlying horizons. The samples can be taken using a spade held level with the lower boundary of the horizon to collect material loosened by a clean trowel or knife.]{.milne}

[Samples are normally taken from the entire thickness of every horizon identified and separately described. If well defined solids of distinct soil material occur within a horizon (e.g. nodules, concretions) their presence and whether or notthat are included in a bulk sample should be recorded (they are normally included). Significant iron and/or humus pans should be treated as horizons and sampled separately. If any apparently homogeneous topsoil horizon more than 25 cm thick, or lower horizon more than 50 cm thick, is identified it should be divided equally and samples taken from each sub-horizon.]{.milne}

[Samples containing particles of soft rock > 2 mm, concretions or nodules liable to disintegrate when prepared for analysis should be noted and the particulars forwarded to the laboratory with the sample so that special precautions can be taken in its preparation.]{.milne}

### Composite topsoil sampling

[A number of 0-75 mm cores]{.milne} (between 5 and 10) [from around the area of the pit is collected. The purpose of this composite sample is to enable some conclusion to be drawn about the representativeness of the topsoil sampled in the pit. The sample is usually taken from]{.milne} a 300 m^2 [area with the core taken beside the left foot every]{.milne} few [paces. The corer, however, should not be put through cow 'pats' or any other obviously non- representative materials. Also care must be taken not to cross the soil boundary.]{.milne}

[The composite sample is labelled with the letter 'z'. A sample from the pit to compare with this composite samples is needed. This pit sample should be 0-75 Â± 10 mm in depth. If the topsoil falls within these limits, the normal horizon sample (A sample) is adequate for the purpose. If the A horizon thickness is greater than about 15 cm then a subdivision at 7.5 cm is appropriate. However, if the A horizon is between about 9 and 15 cm it is usually sampled in total and an extra 0-7.5-cm sample (labelled 'y') is taken for comparison with the composite (z) sample.]{.milne}
