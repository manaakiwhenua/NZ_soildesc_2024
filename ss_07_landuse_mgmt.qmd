Land cover is the physical cover over the soil, both natural and human made. Land use is the purpose(s) for which the land is used and provides context for why a particular land cover is present. Land management describes specific activities that affect land cover, and are driven by land use.

Land cover, use and management information may be captured as part of soil survey when it is relevant to interpreting the landscape, landform, site, and soil profile description, and especially where it is likely to have affected the soil classification. Land use and management practice data is particularly important for long-term monitoring sites, where uses may change significantly between sampling events. Specific recording requirements for routine survey work are listed in @sec-ss-cvusmg.

## Land cover {#sec-lcov}

Land cover in New Zealand is monitored using the Land Cover Database (LCDB, ). The database is used to publish a semi-automated map of land cover, derived from satellite imagery, with a minimum unit size of 1 hectare. The LCDB categories can also be applied on-ground. The categories are listed below, excluding some where it would be physically impossible to observe the soil. The first six are currently mapped to over 80% of New Zealand's land area and so are the most likely to be encountered. The full set of category definitions are available in @manaakiwhenualandcareresearchNewZealandLand2025a.

          55, 'Sub Alpine Shrubland', 'Highland scrub dominated by indigenous low-growing shrubs including species of *Hebe*, *Dracophyllum*, *Olearia*, and *Cassinia*. This class is also recorded where temperature inversions have created cooler micro-climates at lower elevations e.g. the \'frost flats\' of the central North Island.',
          56, 'Mixed exotic shrubland', 'Communities of introduced shrubs and climbers such as boxthorn, hawthorn, elderberry, blackberry, sweet briar, buddleja, and old man\'s beard.',

## Land Use {#sec-luse}

New Zealand currently lacks an official land use classification framework, but a proposal has been developed based on the framework described in @law2024 and can be implemented during soil survey work. This proposed New Zealand Land Use Management (NZLUM) has three nested levels with increasing specificity (@fig-ss-nzlum), and allows for recording further information as 'attributes' of the land use (e.g tenure or management practices).

Land use classification does not have to be carried out in the field provided adequate supporting information (e.g. notes and photographs) are available for later use. Given that the NZLUM is expected to evolve over time, the observation date can be used to infer the edition in use.

## Land Management {#sec-lman}

A fully developed vocabulary for land management practices does not currently exist for New Zealand. Given the multidimensional and constantly evolving nature of land management practice, it will generally be easier to record such information as free text and use text-mining techniques to extract patterns. Key soil-relevant aspects to record may include (but are not limited to) the following:

-   Tillage practices (for arable land)
-   Harvest practices (for tree and vine crops)
-   Planting practices (for tree and vine crops)
-   Crop rotation sequences
-   Grazing systems and stocking rates
-   Weed and other pest control practices
-   Soil amendment and fertilisation practices
-   Irrigation schedule
-   Periodic drainage or flooding
-   Permanent drainage or land surface alterations
-   Time since clearing

In the long term, some of these parameters may become formalised as land use attributes (@sec-luse).
