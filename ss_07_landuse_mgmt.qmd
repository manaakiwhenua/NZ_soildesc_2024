# Land cover, land use, and land management {#sec-lu}

Land cover is the physical cover over the earth's surface, both natural and human made. Land use is the purpose(s) for which the land is used and provides context for why a particular land cover is present. Land management describes specific activities affecting land cover, driven by land use.

Land cover, use and management information is captured as part of soil survey when it is relevant to interpreting the landscape, landform, and soil profile description, and especially where it is likely to have affected the soil classification. Land use data is particularly important for long-term monitoring sites, where uses may change significantly between sampling events.

## Land cover {#sec-lcov}

Land cover in New Zealand is monitored using the Land Cover Database (LCDB, @landcareresearchnewzealandltd2020). The database is used to publish a semi-automated map of land cover, derived from satellite imagery, with a minimum unit size of 1 hectare. The LCDB categories can also be applied on-ground. The categories are listed below, excluding some where it would be physically impossible to observe the soil. The first six are currently mapped to over 80% of New Zealand's land area and so are the most likely to encounter. The full set of category definitions are available in @manaakiwhenualandcareresearch2018.  

Record the dominant land cover of the landform (@sec-gmph-lfm).

## Land Use {#sec-luse}

New Zealand currently lacks an official land use classification framework, but a proposal has been developed [@law2024] and can be implemented during soil survey work. As shown in @fig-ss-nzluc, the proposed New Zealand Standard Land Use Classification (NZSLUC) has three nested levels with increasing specificity. The system also allows for recording further information as 'attributes' of the land use (e.g tenure or management practices). This classification can be applied independent of scale, so advice on how and when to apply it to Landscapes and Landforms follows.

Land use classification does not have to be done in the field provided adequate supporting information (notes and photographs) are available for later use. Given that the classification is expected to evolve over time, the observation date can be used to infer the edition in use.

### Land use at Landscape scale {#sec-luse-lsc}

The Landscape will most likely contain multiple land uses. Record the primary land use and up to two ancillary land uses, but only to the second level of the classification. Uses recorded must be considered to occupy at least 20% of the landscape under examination.

This parameter is optional as it may only be useful when writing high-level reporting or metadata.

### Land use at Landform scale {#sec-luse-lfm}

The Landform is a more local concept. As such it is less likely to contain multiple land uses, and these should be recorded at the third level of the classification. Optionally, record the primary land use within the landform, and up to two ancillary land uses. These do not have to be contained within the land uses recorded at Landscape level, as they may be locally distinct. The uses recorded should occupy at least 20% of the landform under consideration. Where more than one use occurs within a Landform, the primary use is the one considered to have had the most impact on the soil profile being described.

Attribute any recorded land uses with the degree to which they are considered to have impacted the soil profile being described, using @tbl-ss-luimp.

         'E', 'Direct', 'The land use has caused physical disturbance to the soil profile (e.g. from tillage or excavation)')

Example for a site on a mixed sheep and beef farm in hill country: 

- Landscape: Series of steep valleys with some forestry blocks and new waterway exclusion fencing - [2.2]{.ceg} ([2.1]{.ceg}, [1.4]{.ceg})
- Landform: Moderate slope with pasture cover - [2.2.3 M]{.ceg} 

## Land Management {#sec-lman}

A fully developed vocabulary for land management does not currently exist. Given the multidimensional and constantly evolving nature of land management practice, it will generally be easier to record such information as free text and, if necessary, use text-mining techniques to extract patterns. Key soil-relevant aspects to record may include the following:

- Tillage frequency (for arable land)
- Harvest frequency (for forestry)
- Crop rotation sequence
- Stocking rates
- Grazing systems
- Weed control practices
- Soil amendment practices
- Irrigation schedule
- Periodic drainage or flooding
- Permanent drainage alterations

In the long term, some of these parameters may become formalised as land use attributes (@sec-luse).
