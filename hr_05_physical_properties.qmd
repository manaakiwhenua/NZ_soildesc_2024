Consistence is a general term for the field-assessed behaviour of soil materials in response to applied physical stress over a range of soil-water states from wet to dry. The consistence properties described are strength, failure, fluidity, penetration resistance, packing, sensitivity, induration, plasticity, stickiness, dilatancy, and dry coherence.

Consistency tests should be performed down-profile, with at least one sample tested per horizon. Samples should be taken from the mid-point of each horizon. Additional samples in transition zones may also be of interest. Within each horizon, the consistency tests that can and should be undertaken will depend on the cohesion (@sec-dn-prep) of the soil materials in that horizon. @tbl-cn-ct illustrates which tests are appropriate for different soil materials.

::: {#nte-consnzsc .callout-note appearance="minimal" collapse="true" title="Consistence tests and the New Zealand Soil Classification (NZSC)"}
For classifying using the New Zaland Soil Classification, particular tests down to or at a certain depth may be required to progress through the Key to Soil Orders. At the soil order level, these are:

-   **Gley Soils:** must not have any moderately or very fluid (@sec-cn-flu) layers within 30 cm of the soil surface. Unconfined soil strength (@sec-cn-stru) and cementation (@sec-cn-ind) tests may be required to confirm absence of an underlying fragipan.
-   **Ultic Soils:** need an assessment of soil strength (@sec-cn-stru) in the B horizon under moist conditions. May need assessment of failure mode (@sec-cn-fail) over a range of moisture conditions to rule out oxidic or cutanoxidic horizons. May need assessment of sensitivity (@sec-cn-sens) and stickiness (@sec-cn-sti) to rule out allophanic soil materials.
-   **Podzol Soils:** may need unconfined strength (@sec-cn-stru) and failure mode (@sec-cn-fail) tests to help identify a Podzolic B horizon, as well as the presence of humus- and ortstein-pans.
-   **Allophanic Soils:** may need assessment of sensitivity (@sec-cn-sens) and stickiness (@sec-cn-sti) to help confirm the presence of allophanic soil materials.
-   **Melanic Soils:** may require stickiness assessment (@sec-cn-sti) in the B horizon.
-   **Semiarid Soils:** may require cementation tests (@sec-cn-ind) to confirm fragipan absence.
-   **Oxidic Soils:** May need assessment of ped strength (@sec-cn-stra), soil strength (@sec-cn-stru), and failure mode (@sec-cn-fail) over a range of moisture conditions to confirm presence of an oxidic horizon. Stickiness (@sec-cn-sti) and plasticity (@sec-cn-pla) may also be helpful.
-   **Granular Soils:** May need assessment of ped strength (@sec-cn-stra), soil strength (@sec-cn-stru), and failure mode (@sec-cn-fail) over a range of moisture conditions to confirm presence of a cutanoxidic horizon. Stickiness (@sec-cn-sti) and plasticity (@sec-cn-pla) may also be helpful.
-   **Pallic Soils:** may require a negative cementation test (@sec-cn-ind) to help identify any fragipans. May require assessment of failure mode (@sec-cn-fail) to help confirm Brittle-B horizon presence. May require ped strength assessment in the B horizon.
-   **Recent Soils:** must not have any moderately or very fluid (@sec-cn-flu) layers within 30 cm of the soil surface.
:::

## Cohesion {#sec-dn-prep}

The nature of the soil materials in each horizon determines what tests can and should be done. The first step is to determine if the sample is cohesive.

-   **Cohesive soil materials** may have plasticity and stickiness characteristics and have a strength which can be measured in unconfined compression. All listed properties, except particle packing, can be described for non-gravelly, cohesive soils.
-   **Non-cohesive soil materials** have no shear resistance other than that developed by internal friction between grains. Non-cohesive soil materials, by definition, have no unconfined dry strength or plasticity, and the only property that can be meaningfully described is degree of packing or particle packing.

The range of properties which can be described in gravelly, cohesive soils varies with gravel content. In practice, this depends on the feasibility of obtaining samples for the required tests.

The distinction between cohesive and non-cohesive is recognised by performing remoulding (@sec-cn-strr), plasticity (@sec-cn-pla), and dilatancy (@sec-cn-dil) tests in the following sequence (@fig-cn-cohes). Where doubt still remains after these tests have been completed, the dry coherence test (@sec-cn-dryco) may be necessary.

```

### Dry coherence {#sec-cn-dryco}

This test may be used as the final arbiter for distinguishing cohesive from non-cohesive soils if other test results are inconclusive, e.g. in fine silt.

*Procedure*

1.  Remould a 30 mm test sample into a cube, and air-dry.
2.  If the cube collapses under its own weight or after being lightly touched, treat the soil as non-cohesive.

## Strength {#sec-cn-str}

Strength is also known as 'resistance to crushing'. This is assessed using hand or body-weight strength, so the user must calibrate themselves against the classes in @tbl-cn-str. @drohan2020 discuss various options for calibration, including the use of pinch gauges or push-pull gauges to learn what different levels of force feel like.

Each of the tests in this section are evaluated against @tbl-cn-str.

### Unconfined soil strength {#sec-cn-stru}

-   Test at observed field moisture condition.
-   If a test cube cannot be formed, the result is strength class [1]{.ceg} 'Very Weak' (see @tbl-cn-str). This can happen when soil pedality is weak or absent, but also when pedality is strong and peds are small.
-   This test cannot be reliably performed on auger-extracted samples.

*Procedure*

1.  Perform the test on a minimally disturbed 30 mm cube.
2.  Hold the cube between the thumb and forefinger. Both digits must be straight and fully extended.
3.  Pinch down. If the cube can be crushed, rate the difficulty using categories [1-4]{.ceg} in @tbl-cn-str.
4.  If the cube cannot be crushed by hand, attempt to crush it slowly underfoot, against a hard surface. Rate the difficulty using categories [5-7]{.ceg} in @tbl-cn-str.

### Unconfined aggregate strength {#sec-cn-stra}

-   Test at observed field moisture condition.
-   Test on whole peds where they are under 50 mm in size. Larger peds should be shaved down to 30 mm.
-   This test cannot be reliably performed on auger-extracted samples.

*Procedure*

1.  Perform the test on an extracted ped.
2.  Hold the ped between the thumb and forefinger. Both digits must be straight and fully extended.
3.  Pinch down. If the ped can be crushed, rate the difficulty using categories [1-4]{.ceg} in @tbl-cn-str.
4.  If the ped cannot be crushed by hand, attempt to crush it slowly underfoot, against a hard surface. Rate the difficulty using categories [5-7]{.ceg} in @tbl-cn-str.

### Remoulded strength {#sec-cn-strr}

Some soils lose strength to a notable degree when remoulded, and their apparent clay content as estimated with hand texturing increases.

-   Test at observed field moisture condition.
-   Perform the test on an extracted 30 mm cube or sample of equivalent volume.
-   This test may be performed on auger-extracted samples.

*Procedure*

1.  Perform the test on an extracted 30 mm cube or sample of equivalent volume.
2.  Place the sample in a small plastic bag and seal with the air excluded (this maintains field moisture content while remoulding). Work the sample until its structure is completely broken down. This may take several minutes.
3.  Still in the bag, remould the soil into a cube and assess its strength against @tbl-cn-str.
4.  Use @tbl-cn-sens to also record the ratio of unconfined to remoulded strength ('sensitivity', @sec-cn-sens).

### Strength at plastic limit {#sec-cn-strp}

Soil strength at the plastic limit has engineering implications.

-   Test at the soil's plastic limit.
-   Perform the test on an extracted 30 mm cube or sample of equivalent volume.
-   This test can be reliably performed on auger-extracted samples.

*Procedure*

1.  Work the sample until its structure is completely broken down. This may take several minutes. Keep adding small amounts of water so that the sample is almost, but not quite, saturated.
2.  Remould the soil into a cube and assess its strength against @tbl-cn-str.

## Sensitivity {#sec-cn-sens}

In soils with an unconfined strength class of [4]{.ceg} firm or greater, sensitivity is reported as the ratio of unconfined soil strength (@sec-cn-stru) to remoulded strength (@sec-cn-strr). For weaker soils, the 'shear test' is performed. The two methods are assigned equivalent classes in @tbl-cn-sens.

-   Test soil at a moist or wet state.
-   Perform the test on a minimally disturbed 30 mm sample cube.
-   This test cannot be reliably performed on auger-extracted samples.

*Procedure*

1.  Hold the sample cube between extended thumb and forefinger as for @sec-cn-str.
2.  Pinch and press the sample to create a lateral, 'shear' force, moving the finger forward and down over the thumb.
3.  Assess the sample behaviour against @tbl-cn-sens.

## Plasticity {#sec-cn-pla}

Plasticity is the capacity of soil material to change shape continuously when stress is applied and to retain that shape after the removal of stress.

-   Test soil at a wet state.
-   Perform the test on 3-4 cm^3^ of soil.
-   This test may be performed on auger-extracted samples.

*Procedure*

1.  Thoroughly remould the sample, keeping it in a wet state.
2.  Adjust the water content to slightly above the plastic limit. In practice this water content is slightly above that at which a 4-mm diameter roll of sample crumbles but less than that when sample becomes sticky (@sec-cn-sti), if stickiness is exhibited.
3.  Attempt to roll the sample out into a rod of 40 mm length. Assess the minimum achievable diameter of the rod and its behaviour using @tbl-cn-plas.

## Stickiness {#sec-cn-sti}

Stickiness is the degree to which remoulded soil adheres to external objects.

-   Test soil at a wet state.
-   Perform the test on 3-4 cm^3^ of soil.
-   This test may be performed on auger-extracted samples.

*Procedure*

1.  Thoroughly remould the sample, keeping it in a wet state.
2.  Press the remoulded material between thumb and forefinger, and note its adherence to the fingers.
3.  Adjust the water content by working the sample in the hand to remove water, or by adding water as necessary to achieve the maximum stickiness that the material will exhibit.
4.  Assess maximum stickiness and record using @tbl-cn-stik.

## Dilatancy {#sec-cn-dil}

Dilatancy occurs due to volume change during shearing and is used as a criterion for the distinguishing non-cohesive from cohesive soil materials.

-   Test soil at a moist to wet state.
-   Perform the test on 3-4 cm^3^ of soil.
-   This test may be performed on auger-extracted samples.

*Procedure*

1.  Adjust the soil to a moist to wet state.
2.  Roll into a ball \~30 mm diameter.
3.  Hold sample in upturned palm and slap the back of the hand containing the sample several times with the other hand.

A dilatant reaction is shown by a shiny surface caused by water extrusion, and by a dull surface when the palm of the hand is folded to partly remould the sample, causing water to be drawn into the sample. dilatant samples will also lose their ball shape, flattening down. Record dilatant behaviour as a binary, [true/false]{.ceg}.

## Penetration resistance {#sec-cn-pres}

Penetration resistance is the capacity of the soil, in its natural confined state, to resist penetration by rigid objects. This property is commonly related to strength by empirical means (@tbl-cn-penr).

-   This test requires a large pit or exposure.

*Procedure*

1.  Expose a soil profile.
2.  Assess ease of penetrating a vertical face using @tbl-cn-penr.

::: {#nte-ppen .callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Use of pocket penetrometers"}
Pocket-sized penetrometers with a 6 mm flat tip are often recommended for assessing penetration resistance of cohesive materials in the field. These devices can usually measure no more than 400-1000 kPa and so may not be adequate for measurements in hard soils.

## Particle Packing {#sec-sn-pack}

Particle packing assesses the stability of a gravelly soil.

-   Test only on gravelly soils where strength cannot be assessed
-   This test requires a large pit or exposure
-   Do not test at wet or saturated field moisture conditions, as this is unsafe

*Procedure*

1.  Expose a gravelly soil profile.
2.  Assess ease of excavating and maintaining a vertical face using @tbl-cn-pack.

::: {#nte-singbl .callout-note appearance="minimal" title="Use of the Singleton Blade"}
The Singleton blade was a device invented in the 1980s by the New Zealand pedologist Peter Singleton to improve on packing density assessment methods available at the time. The device was thin, flexible piece of metal that was inserted into the pit face. A pocket penetrometer was then used to push the end of the blade sideways until it reached 45° or fell out. The penetrometer reading was empirically correlated to packing density. Mention of this device can be found in many New Zealand soil publications from \~1980-2000 [@griffiths1999] but has not been made commercially available and is now rarely used.

## Mode of failure {#sec-cn-fail}

Failure is the manner in which unconfined soil yields to increasing stress.

-   Test at observed field moisture condition.
-   Perform the test on a minimally disturbed 30 mm cube or aggregate.
-   If diagnosing Oxidic or Cutanoxidic soil material for the NZSC, repeat the test under dry to wet moisture conditions.

*Procedure*

1.  Perform the unconfined strength test according to @sec-cn-stru.
2.  At strengths of class [4]{.ceg} or less, mode of failure can be observed. Assess and record per @tbl-cn-fail.

## Fluidity {#sec-cn-flu}

Fluidity tests whether saturated soils have an unconfined strength that is largely eliminated by saturation. Such materials were generally emplaced under water, have never been drained, have a fine texture that minimises gravity-based settling, and are not overlain by enough other sediment to have been compressed.

-   Test soil at a saturated state.
-   Only test soils that are saturated under field conditions.
-   Perform the test on \~50 cm^3^ of soil (a large handful).
-   This test may be performed on auger-extracted samples.

*Procedure*

1.  Extract the sample and squeeze firmly in the hand.
2.  Evaluate the sample behaviour using @tbl-cn-fluid.

#| label: tbl-cn-fluid
#| tbl-cap: "Fluidity classes"

## Induration {#sec-cn-ind}

Induration is the degree to which soil particles are held together by some combination of cementation and close packing.

-   Perform the test on a minimally disturbed 30 mm cube or aggregate.
-   This test may also be performed on individual nodules and other solids \< 30 mm.
-   This test cannot be reliably performed on auger-extracted samples.
-   This test requires a minimum one hour to complete so may be done immediately following fieldwork.

*Equipment*

-   Sponge (\~50 mm diameter, flat)
-   Deionised (DI) water
-   Sample container at least 40-50 mm deep

*Procedure*

1.  Test the soil strength at field-moist condition according to @sec-cn-stru.
2.  Place the sample cube on a wet sponge until thoroughly moistened, then immerse the sample in DI water for 1 hour.
3.  If the sample has not slaked (see @sec-ft-slak), retest the soil strength of the wet sample according to @sec-cn-stru.
4.  Assess the behaviour of the sample using @tbl-cn-ind.
