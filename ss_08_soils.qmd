## Soils in New Zealand {#sec-soil}

Most parts of New Zealand have at least some existing soils knowledge documented in various forms. These resources can be a valuable starting point when conducting new research or survey work.

### Māori soil knowledge {#sec-soil-m}

The traditional Māori understanding of soils and its development into modern systems can be explored in @harmsworth2014; @harmsworth2014a; @harmsworth2022.

### Legacy soil mapping {#sec-soil-leg}

Post-settlement soil mapping in New Zealand started as early as the 1910s. Many of these records have been digitised and can be explored on the Manaaki Whenua [Legacy Map Viewer](https://soils.landcareresearch.co.nz/tools/legacy-map-viewer). Accompanying reports are available from the Manaaki Whenua [Digital Library](https://soils.landcareresearch.co.nz/resources/soil-publications/soil-publications-dl). Pātaka Oneone, the [Manaaki Whenua Soils Portal](https://soils.landcareresearch.co.nz/), offers many more resources for accessing knowledge about New Zealand's soils.

### Modern soil mapping {#sec-soil-mod}

The flagship regional-scale soil mapping product for New Zealand is the S-Map. Information about S-Map, including a web-based interactive map, is available at [S-Map Online](https://smap.landcareresearch.co.nz/).

### Books about New Zealand Soils {#sec-soil-books}
