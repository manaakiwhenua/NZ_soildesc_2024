## Soils {#sec-soil}

Most parts of New Zealand have at least some existing soils knowledge documented in various forms. These resources can be a valuable starting point when conducting new research or survey work.

### Māori soil knowledge  {#sec-soil-m}

The traditional Māori understanding of soils and its development into modern systems can be explored in [@harmsworth2014; @harmsworth2014a; @harmsworth2022].

### Legacy soil mapping {#sec-soil-leg}

Post-settlement soil mapping in New Zealand started as early as the 1910s. Many of these records have been digitised and can be explored on the Manaaki Whenua [Legacy Map Viewer](https://soils.landcareresearch.co.nz/tools/legacy-map-viewer). Accompanying reports are available from the Manaaki Whenua [Digital Library](https://soils.landcareresearch.co.nz/resources/soil-publications/soil-publications-dl).
