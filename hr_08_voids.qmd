# Voids

- NB surface cracks already covered

## Pores

- abundance 
- macro v micro sizes
- inferred origin
- direct and indirect observation for connectivity

## Other voids

- non-infilled space between coarse gravels (assessed via packing)
- spaces between dry peds (where shrink-swell is significant)
